Farmers have switched crops or sold their land.\n\nNestl\u00e9, which is counting on growth in its coffee business as it overhauls its business to improve performance, works with a local milling and marketing company, Coffee Management Services (CMS), to train farmers regularly on fertiliser application, pest, and disease control. It provides seedlings for farmers wishing to plant more.\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t know how and when to apply fertiliser properly. Nestl\u00e9 has taught us a lot,\u201d said William Njeru, a farmer who harvested 7,600 kilogrammes last year, up from around 1,200 kilogrammes a year before he joined the project five years ago.\n\n\u201cIf we can have other partners who are doing what Nestl\u00e9 is doing, the multiplier effect on productivity in Kenya can be very high,\u201d said Peter Kimata, deputy head of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s partner CMS.\n\nA half-hour\u2019s drive up the road from his office sits an abandoned coffee factory with rusting machinery.\n\nFarmer Moses Wachira says it was closed in 2013 after its management embezzled farmers\u2019 money. That forced 500 farmers to start selling their coffee to brokers who offer lower prices.\n\n\u201cThese problems are causing production to fall because nobody watches to ensure managers do not misappropriate farmers\u2019 money,\u201d said the white-bearded farmer.\n\nKenya\u2019s harvest fell 12% in the 2016-17 season to 40,700 metric tonnes, according to government data.\n\nGovernment efforts to revive the sector have faltered. Last year, a judge stopped the government from acting on the recommendations of an official report on ways to boost coffee production after farmers claimed they were not consulted.\n\nSome Kenyan farmers will miss out on expanding the crop to meet the target of 2% to 3% annual growth in global demand for coffee, according to Nestl\u00e9, as consumers discover new ways of consuming coffee, including capsules and cold brews.\n\nDemand for coffee is also growing locally.\n\nIn Kenya, cafe chain Java, owned by Dubai-based private equity firm Abraaj, opened its first shop in 1999 and has grown to 68 retail outlets as an emerging middle class and young professionals develop a taste for lattes and mocha.\n\n\u201cThe coffee has to come from somewhere,\u201d said Canz.", "date": "03-21-2018", "url": "http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2018/03/21/nestle-provides-lifeline-for-struggling-kenyan-coffee-farmers/", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "summary": "Nestl\u00e9 has been working with coffee farmers in Kenya in a mutually-beneficial project: it will receive more coffee beans, while the farmers will receive more revenue.\n\u201cThe coffee has disappeared,\u201d said Canz, who co-manages Switzerland-based Nestl\u00e9\u2019s partnerships with coffee farmers globally.\nAlarmed by a steep drop in the country\u2019s production, Nestl\u00e9, which buys 10% of the world\u2019s coffee and has the leading packaged coffee business, is working with farmers to guarantee its supplies.\nMary Wanja, with 350 coffee trees on her plot in rural Kirinyaga at the foot of Mount Kenya, is one of more than 40,000 of Kenya\u2019s 600,000 coffee farmers participating in the project.\nLast year, a judge stopped the government from acting on the recommendations of an official report on ways to boost coffee production after farmers claimed they were not consulted.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today"}, {"title": "Nestle pledges to make all its packaging recyclable by 2025", "keyword": ["company", "packaging", "chain", "plastics", "recycling", "2025", "food", "pledges", "nestle", "waste", "plastic", "recyclable", "singleuse"], "top-image": "http://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nestle.jpg", "text": "Environmentalists have criticised the plan as lacking substance.\n\nZURICH: Nestle wants to make all of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025, the Swiss food giant said on Tuesday, becoming the latest food company to vow to reduce plastic waste.\n\nEnvironmentalists criticised the plan as lacking substance.\n\nEuropean governments have stepped up efforts to reduce plastic waste littering land and sea, and companies across the food supply chain are following suit.

I\u2019ve worked in Nestl\u00e9 for three and a half years as a security executive, but in one year, my performance was not good,\u201d the furious man declared, adding that despite the procedures being similar, he wondered what went wrong.\n\n\u201cSo many companies out there are retrenching people because the economy's damn bloody f****** bad, so how are you going to help us?... We want a good solution, don\u2019t just promise whatever you want to promise because the GE14 is coming up.\u201d\n\nThe man further accused the premier of \u201cDestroying everything\u201d \u2013 resulting in him being unable to take care of his family \u2013 while challenging Najib to debate with the rakyat instead of politicians.\n\n\u201cHopefully this message will go out to PM Najib. Tell me how you can help me! Not only me but the people who share the same fate as me,\u201d the man urged in the over three-minute clip circulated on Facebook last week.\n\nThough Najib has not responded to his video at the time of writing, Zee How Tai, fired his remarks to the 'Pakcik Nestl\u00e9' in a Facebook video posting yesterday.\n\nSpeaking as a Malaysian, Zee quoted another netizen who pointed out amid the headwinds, Nestl\u00e9 had increased its profits over the years, adding that in JobStreet, the food and beverage company was still looking for new hires.\n\n\u201cNow, everything including your retrenchment is Najib\u2019s fault? One fine day when the sun is way too hot and if your car skids and lands in a drain, that too is Najib\u2019s fault? Everything is Najib\u2019s fault! Blame it on Najib, that would be the easiest way out!\u201d Zee expressed.\n\nHowever, Zee remarked despite his friends sharing the same sentiment as 'Pakcik Nestl\u00e9', \u201cI don\u2019t blame Najib. This is a developing country. Usually in developing countries, food is scarce, education is poor. Just look at some of our neighbouring countries,\" he said without naming any examples.\n\n\"Even my friends who blame Najib, their previous bonuses were lucrative and they used to travel to Europe but now complain that this year they could only afford to travel to Bangkok due to their measly bonus.\n\n\"These days, we blame Najib because we aren\u2019t able to travel to Europe but only to Bangkok. We blame Najib because we underperformed and got retrenched.\n\n\u201cOne day Malaysia will be better off without Najib. If Najib steps down, is defeated or the Opposition wins, uncle, you will get your job back, the sun will shine less and those who were only able to travel to Bangkok will be able to travel to Europe,\u201d he sarcastically took a jab.\n\nConcluding his response, Zee asked for the 'uncle' to complain to Dr Mahathir Mohamad who was elected as Pakatan Harapan prime minister instead to perhaps change his fate and wished him \u201cGood luck!\u201d\n\nZee\u2019s video has received over 1,000 shares and likes at the time of writing, with many praising his candid response.\n\nAnd Zee\u2019s words could not be further from the truth. Despite news of rentrenchment due to the economic challenges, as we move towards a digital economy, International Trade and Industries Minister Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed revealed from 2014 to 2016, over 153,000 jobs in manufacturing projects have been created.\n\n\u201cAn additional 32,700 jobs in the manufacturing sector will be created from the investment secured in the period January-September 2017. A number of new investments and expansion undertaken by companies last year have created more job opportunities in the country.\n\n\u201cOil and gas companies are also starting to hire again, especially in the upstream and offshore businesses, as they seek to capitalise on the new found high oil price in recent times,\u201d Mustapa said.\n\nChief employment insurance system (EIS) officer of Social Security Organisation (Socso), Datuk Mohd Sahar Darusman also recently clarified that the national unemployment rate has held steady at below 4% and retrenchment figures rarely exceeded 40,000 persons and the figure is forecast to stay below this level in 2018.\n\n\u201cI assume for the next one or two years, the retrenchment figure will be the same as last year at about 36,000 [persons]. Anything below 40,000 shows a perfectly normal liquidity in the labour market,\u201d Mohd Sahar stated last month.\n\nThis goes to show that there are companies who are still hiring people out there. Hence, in saying which, perhaps with a little effort and a lot of hard work, those who are retrenched or find themselves in a bad predicament with their jobs, should start looking for new prospects and start doing so immediately for a better livelihood.\n\nAs the saying goes, if you have time to whine and complain (in this case record a video on social media even), then you have time to do something about it.\n\n-mD", "date": "02-04-2018", "url": "http://malaysiandigest.com/frontpage/29-4-tile/721355-video-to-the-pakcik-nestle-who-blamed-najib-for-his-retrenchment-read-this.html", "authors": [], "summary": "Though Najib has not responded to his video at the time of writing, Zee How Tai, fired his remarks to the 'Pakcik Nestl\u00e9' in a Facebook video posting yesterday.\nBlame it on Najib, that would be the easiest way out!\u201d Zee expressed.\nHowever, Zee remarked despite his friends sharing the same sentiment as 'Pakcik Nestl\u00e9', \u201cI don\u2019t blame Najib.\n\"These days, we blame Najib because we aren\u2019t able to travel to Europe but only to Bangkok.\nWe blame Najib because we underperformed and got retrenched.", "news": "malaysiandigest.com"}, {"title": "Nestle Malaysia looks set for another good year - Business News", "keyword": ["company", "halal", "strong", "market", "companys", "products", "increasing", "share", "nestle", "set", "business", "product", "hofbauer", "good", "looks"], "top-image": "http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2018/04/27/18/49/p6_bizw_270418_pg06aaa_tankimbock_1.ashx/?w=620&h=413&crop=1&hash=BA1ACB04DB50C97D3174D77FC6A86B20EC436C17", "text": "A CONSISTENT performer and market leader in the food and beverage (F&B) industry, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd is on track for another strong performance this year.\n\nIn fact, the company says, it is looking to record higher gross margins of close to 50%, backed by a stronger ringgit and lower commodity prices.\n\nNestle imports some of its key raw materials such as milk, cocoa, wheat and coffee, as well as some packaging materials, making it a beneficiary of both the stronger ringgit and lower commodity prices.\n\nThe company has already recorded a strong start to the year, with domestic sales increasing 4.4% in the first quarter, and exports rising 3.4%, with total sales up 4.2%.\n\nRevenue was up 4.2% at RM1.43bil.\n\nIn FY17, the group saw its revenue increasing 3.9% to RM5.3bil, while profit after tax rose 1.4% to RM646mil.\n\nNestle, which held a 14.3% share of the Malaysian F&B market in 2016, also managed to expand its share to 15.5% last year, and is far ahead of its competitors.\n\nWhile the company does not have a specific target to increase market share, CEO Alois Hofbauer says the company continuously strives to strengthen market share across their many product categories via product innovations and strategic marketing as well as promotional initiatives.\n\nThe company\u2019s products, such as Milo, Maggi and Kit Kat chocolates, are cult favourites among Malaysians.\n\nHofbauer, who calls the company an \u201cinnovation machine\u201d, says it comes up with up to 40 new products each year.\n\nLast year, the new product offerings contributed about RM380mil in sales.\n\nThis year, Hofbauer expects the company\u2019s new products to contribute around 10% the group\u2019s domestic sales, at an estimated RM400mil.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s recent launches are the MAGGI Pedas Giler, a spicy addition to the company\u2019s range of bowl noodles; NESCAFE\u00ae Black Ice, black coffee in a can with a minty icy cool aftertaste; and MILO Nutri-Up, the chocolate malt beverage enriched with calcium and added protein, packaged in a bottle.\n\n\u201cInnovation is the lifeblood of Nestl\u00e9. We believe that it is a continuous process to improve and upgrade products to better suit consumers\u2019 wants and needs.\n\n\u201cConsumers these days are geared towards convenience and we have made solid investments in this new trend.\n\n\u201cFor example, in 2015, we invested in a new factory which manufactures ready-to-drink products, and we continuously innovate to launch on-the-go products,\u201d he tells StarBizWeek.\n\nAnother key factor that will contribute to the company\u2019s performance moving forward, he says, is the improved efficiencies at their factories.\n\nPost-GST consumer sentiment, on the other hand, has yet to fully recover.\n\n\u201cWhile consumer sentiment was impacted post-GST in previous years, it has since improved, particularly over the past few quarters.\n\n\u201cThis year will continue to be challenging until consumer sentiment fully regains and stabilises on pre-GST level and in view of tough competition in the market,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, he says the company is well-prepared for the challenge with its strong brand portfolio and ability to continuously innovate and evolve its business.\n\nMoving forward, Hofbauer notes that the company is setting aside between RM150mil and RM200mil in capex each year for the next three to four years.\n\nThis year, the amount set aside is RM180mil, and the money will be spent on several focus areas which include its fast-growing confectionary and culinary products.\n\nThis amount, however, doesn\u2019t include its marketing and trade promotion spend, which stands at RM1.2bil each year.\n\nOn the increasing competition in the country\u2019s F&B sector, Hofbauer says the company welcomes \u201chealthy\u201d competition.\n\nIncreasing product prices to compete, however, will be the company\u2019s \u201clast resort\u201d.\n\n\u201cConsumers today are discerning and look for good quality products and healthier options that are affordable.\n\n\u201cThis is something which Nestl\u00e9 provides with our products. I don\u2019t think price is the only way to compete - price is a tool, but not always best option.\n\n\u201cIncreasing prices will always be the last resort as our aim is to grow our volume organically,\u201d he says.\n\nHofbauer adds that the company\u2019s procurement hub in Malaysia helps it to be more cost efficient.\n\nThe hub, launched last year, is one of Nestle\u2019s three global procurement hubs, besides those in Switzerland and Panama.\n\nWhile it is not a typical export company, Nestle\u2019s global halal production centre currently exports to over 50 countries.\n\n\u201cWe do not only produce halal products, we also provide halal production expertise,\u201d he says.

By comparison, the FBM KLCI was trading at 16.42 times 2018 estimates.\n\nLed by the sharp rise in its share price, the Swiss food and beverage (F&B) giant\u2019s market valuation has gained a whopping RM16.56 billion in just one year.\n\nIf an investor had bought 1,000 Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia shares at RM79.40 each a year ago and held on to them, his investment of RM79,400 would have earned him a total return of 42.9% or RM70,600 as at last Tuesday, excluding dividends for the year of RM2.75 per share.\n\nTo take or to leave the profit is the question shareholders are asking themselves. Do the shares have further upside?\n\nFour analysts tracked by Bloomberg are advising their clients to sell the stock while seven have a \u201chold\u201d call on it. None recommend buying the stock.\n\nCEO Alois Hofbauer points out that Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia\u2019s share price has almost tripled since he took the company\u2019s helm on Feb 22, 2013, when the stock was trading at around RM57.\n\nThe 52-year-old Austrian opines that the company\u2019s strong performance is reflected in the share price\u2019s upward trend, which, in turn, reflects investors\u2019 optimism about its growth prospects.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Malaysia delivered another record net profit and revenue last year, mainly driven by volume growth and efficient cost controls.\n\nFor the year ended Dec 31, 2017, its net profit rose 1.4% year on year to RM645.8 million on revenue of RM5.26 billion, which was up 3.9%. This was Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia\u2019s third consecutive year of record profit.\n\nThe company also maintained its lead in the local F&B market, commanding 15.5% of it last year, up from 14.3% in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe year 2017 was good for us amid a challenging environment, given the higher commodity prices and a weakened ringgit. We grew close to 4% (in revenue) even though the market was flat at about 1%. Also, our domestic sales, which account for 80% of our overall sales, grew faster than our exports,\u201d Hofbauer tells The Edge.\n\nHe does not expect the operating environment to be any easier this year, but believes the company could continue to deliver earnings growth, given its track record. However, he stopped short of giving his guidance for Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia\u2019s performance this year as it is a public-listed company.\n\n\u201cWhat I can say with certainty is that the way we have improved ourselves over the years and put our strength in place, and also with our track record, we are [well equipped] to take advantage of an upswing, but even better, we can weather any storm.\n\n\u201cAlready, we are delivering good growth in challenging times, which means when the times get a little bit easier, we can grow much faster.\u201d\n\nImproving consumer sentiment and new product offerings are two major factors that Hofbauer sees driving the company\u2019s growth this year.\n\nLike previously, the company is looking to launch 30 to 40 new products this year. However, Hofbauer notes that the number of new offerings really does not matter to him as he attaches more importance to the size of their contribution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t measure our success by the number of products launched but by the contribution of these new products to our overall sales growth. For me, I want around 10% of our sales to come from new products and (launching) 30 to 40 products would more or less give us that percentage,\u201d he says.\n\nLast year, Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia saw its gross margin decline by 2.7 percentage points to 36.7% mainly due to higher raw material prices. The company expects higher volume and efficiency in its operations to offset the decline in gross margin this year.\n\n\u201cNow that the prices of raw materials are falling and the ringgit is stronger, this should be good news for us,\u201d Hofbauer says. Year to date, the local currency has recovered 3.8% to 3.865 against the greenback.\n\nStill, Hofbauer has concerns about the ringgit and world economic volatility this year. \u201cEven though the ringgit has recovered against the US dollar, it is still not at the level it was when I took over as CEO five years ago. At the time, the ringgit was trading at 3.20 versus the US dollar.\u201d\n\nAnother of Hofbauer\u2019s worries is global economic volatility, which has an impact on commodity prices. \u201cWe have three big buckets of commodities that we are watching very carefully. They are milk powder, wheat flour and cocoa.\u201d\n\nBut he notes that the cost of goods is only part of the whole equation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, we not only buy our raw materials on a big scale but we also hedge on commodities and currencies. Our hedging positions could be anything from one month to one year as we see fit.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we continuously work on making our internal systems more efficient to deliver the savings needed as part of our three-pillar FIT strategy. This allows us to mitigate any fluctuation in commodity prices,\u201d he adds.\n\nThis \u201cfuel to grow\u201d pillar enabled the company to save RM195 million last year, bringing the total savings since the inception of the FIT strategy in 2013 to RM843 million. The other two pillars are \u201cinnovate to grow\u201d and \u201ctransform to grow\u201d.\n\nHofbauer says the FIT strategy has worked well for the company, which has seen its profits grow year on year since the strategy was introduced, except in 2014 when it was affected by the weak performance of its exports to affiliated companies. The situation was compounded by the fact that the Philippines and Indonesia invested in local manufacturing facilities for products previously imported from Malaysia.\n\nHofbauer also notes that the company continues to invest strongly in marketing and promotional activities each year. \u201cWe have increased our overall marketing spend by more than 50% to RM1.2 billion, up from RM800 million five years ago.\u201d\n\nOn parent Nestl\u00e9 SA\u2019s decision to set up a global procurement hub in Malaysia last year, Hofbauer says it has benefited Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia as it enables the company to enjoy better prices and better quality raw and packaging materials on a consistent basis. Known as Nestrade SA, the hub is completely separate from the Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia business.\n\nOn its part, Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia is opening the group\u2019s biggest state-of-the-art warehouse in Asia in Klang in the middle of this year. With a built-up area of 515,000 sq ft, it will be used by Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia as a distribution centre.\n\n\u201cThe warehouse is on a lease basis from Axis Real Estate Investment Trust and so, the capital expenses are minimal,\u201d says Hofbauer.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Malaysia invests roughly RM200 million per year in capital expenditure. According to Hofbauer, it will be about the same amount this year. \u201cWe plan to invest in our confectionery and culinary businesses to enhance our industry footprint, which will give us additional volume.\u201d\n\nOn its plan to raise the prices of its products this year, Hofbauer estimates an increase of 2% to 3% on average across the board. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s a last resort. We try to create efficiencies around our costs, but sometimes it [price increase] is unavoidable. If any, it will be very moderate.\u201d\n\nAs one of the hottest stocks on the market as well as the priciest, Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia is an easy target for those advocating more stock splits. However, Hofbauer says there are currently no plans to do so.\n\nIn January, the company had to deal with bad publicity after a video on the sugar content of the popular chocolate malt drink, Milo, went viral. However, Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia successfully turned the crisis into an opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that it gave us an opportunity to communicate facts, for example, that a cup of Milo contains only one teaspoon of sugar, with our consumers via social media. Milo sales, believe it or not, were very good in the first quarter of the year. Its market share has gone up,\u201d says Hofbauer.\n\nOn e-commerce sales through online platforms such as Lazada, Shoppee and 11 Street, Hofbauer says they are growing at an accelerated rate. \u201cLast year, [e-commerce] sales tripled and we expect sales to triple again this year. At some point, we expect this segment to become a RM500 million business for us, which is significant. And this is not going to take many years. I think this is going to happen much faster than we think.\u201d\n\nToday, e-commerce sales contribute 1% to the company\u2019s total sales. Hofbauer believes a 10% contribution is \u201cnot far away, potentially in five years\u2019 time\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe now have around 15% to 16% market share of online grocery sales. Our e-commerce sales make up about 30% of the online F&B market, which is double that of our physical market share,\u201d he says.", "date": "04-16-2018", "url": "http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/nestl%C3%A9-malaysia-unfazed-equity-sugar-rush", "authors": [], "summary": "Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia delivered another record net profit and revenue last year, mainly driven by volume growth and efficient cost controls.\nHowever, he stopped short of giving his guidance for Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia\u2019s performance this year as it is a public-listed company.\n\u201cI don\u2019t measure our success by the number of products launched but by the contribution of these new products to our overall sales growth.\n\u201cWe now have around 15% to 16% market share of online grocery sales.\nOur e-commerce sales make up about 30% of the online F&B market, which is double that of our physical market share,\u201d he says.", "news": "The Edge Markets MY"}, {"title": "Nestle Malaysia\u2019s EPS growth higher than other Nestle companies", "keyword": ["malaysias", "companies", "share", "nestle", "higher", "growth", "dividend", "eps", "yield", "projected", "price", "fy18", "stock"], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Nestle-1_20180410103642_reuters.jpg?null", "text": "Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd\n\n(April 9, RM149.60)\n\nMaintain sell with a target price (TP) of RM129.90: We believe Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd shares are fully valued at this level and therefore downgrade our call from \u201chold\u201d to \u201csell\u201d with an unchanged TP of RM129.90 per share based on dividend discount model (DDM) valuation. The bases of the downgrade in the stock call include: Nestle Malaysia shares are trading over 50 times price-earnings ratio (PER) and the dividend yield for financial year 2018 (FY18) is projected to be below 2.5%. We made no change to our earnings forecasts.\n\nTaking into account the defensive quality of the stock, which would offer a safe haven in a volatile market before the 14th general election, and also the strength of ringgit movement and the downward trend in the skimmed milk powder price (-9.5% year-on-year to US$1,849 or RM 7,156 per tonne), we selected Nestle Malaysia as one of our stock picks for 2018 on Dec 8, 2017, when the share price was RM102.40.\n\nLast Friday, Nestle Malaysia\u2019s share price closed at RM149 after hitting its all-time high of RM163 in mid-March. It has advanced about 44.4% year-to-date (YTD) and is currently trading at 46.2 times FY18 earnings. We find that this is a huge premium to Nestle Malaysia\u2019s three-year historical PER of an average of 28.9 times. Furthermore, Nestle Malaysia is relatively expensive if we compare it with its sister companies listed on other stock exchanges, suggesting that foreign investors may likely take profit on Nestle Malaysia and switch to other cheaper Nestle stocks in other countries.\n\nApart from the PER level, a peer comparison indicates that Nestle Malaysia\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) growth is 4.7 percentage points (ppts) higher than other Nestle companies\u2019 average of 12.3% for FY18, while in terms of return on equity (ROE), Nestle Malaysia\u2019s value is more than double the average ROE of all Nestle companies (52.7% for FY18). Recognised as a stable dividend stock, the Nestle group of companies has an average projected dividend yield of 3% for FY18. However, at the current share price, Nestle Malaysia\u2019s FY18 dividend yield is projected to be only 2%, which is 1ppt lower than its sister companies.\n\nNestle Malaysia is projected to pay dividends of RM3 per share for FY18, representing a yield of 1.9% based on its closing price in March 2018, 2ppts lower than 10-year Malaysian Government Securities\u2019 yield of 3.95% as at end-March 2018.\n\nThe compressing level of dividend yields caused by share price increases is reducing the stock\u2019s attractiveness as a safe haven. Local investors should opt for other stable and low-risk investments in Malaysia, such as fixed deposits, bonds or even other undervalued dividend stocks. All in, we believe the relatively high PER and compressed dividend yield of Nestle Malaysia suggest that investors are overpaying for safety. As such, we downgrade Nestle Malaysia from \u201chold\u201d to \u201csell\u201d with an unchanged TP of RM129.90 per share based on DDM valuation. \u2014 TA Securities, April 9", "date": "04-09-2018", "url": "http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/nestle-malaysias-eps-growth-higher-other-nestle-companies", "authors": [], "summary": "Last Friday, Nestle Malaysia\u2019s share price closed at RM149 after hitting its all-time high of RM163 in mid-March.\nWe find that this is a huge premium to Nestle Malaysia\u2019s three-year historical PER of an average of 28.9 times.\nApart from the PER level, a peer comparison indicates that Nestle Malaysia\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) growth is 4.7 percentage points (ppts) higher than other Nestle companies\u2019 average of 12.3% for FY18, while in terms of return on equity (ROE), Nestle Malaysia\u2019s value is more than double the average ROE of all Nestle companies (52.7% for FY18).\nRecognised as a stable dividend stock, the Nestle group of companies has an average projected dividend yield of 3% for FY18.\nHowever, at the current share price, Nestle Malaysia\u2019s FY18 dividend yield is projected to be only 2%, which is 1ppt lower than its sister companies.", "news": "The Edge Markets MY"}, {"title": "Nestle Malaysia names Dr Nirmala Menon as board member", "keyword": ["insurance", "today", "management", "board", "nestle", "officer", "independent", "nonexecutive", "menon", "directors", "nirmala", "member", "names"], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Nestle-5_20180514150022_reuters.jpg?null", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (May 14): Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd today announced the appointment of its new independent non-executive director Datuk Dr Nirmala Menon following the retirement of independent non-executive directors Toh Puan Datuk Seri Hajjah Dr Aishah Ong and Tan Sri Datuk Yong Poh Kon.\n\nIn a statement today, Nestle said Menon has had extensive experience in the field of insurance services, including prominent positions in various companies\n\n\"In addition, she made her mark as the first woman chief executive officer in the life insurance industry in Malaysia, helming ING Malaysia Bhd as president and CEO,\" said Nestle.\n\nPrior to her career in the insurance industry, she was a medical officer at Hospital Kuala Lumpur for seven years.

Stuart added that by doing so, Nestle hopes to avoid \u201cfurther confusion\u201d about how the rating system is designed, as well as \u201creduce the risk of damage to a system which is fundamentally sound\u201d.\n\nThe sugary chocolate powder was initially labelled 4.5 stars, with Nestle arguing that the product was designed to be consumed as three teaspoons along with a cup of skim milk. However, Choice was one of the groups that claimed the drink was not consumed in that specified manner among Australian consumers. According to a survey it conducted, only 13% of Australians drink MILO with skim milk, while 55% consume it with full cream milk. As such, it should only receive a 1.5 star rating.\n\nIn a statement to Marketing, Health Promotion Board\u2019s (HPB) spokesperson said HPB\u2019s view is that there are no intrinsically bad food or good food. Eating healthy is about maintaining a balanced diet and eating in moderation. The spokesperson added that HPB does not encourage the excessive consumption of any foods, including those labelled with the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS).\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, the HCS is a form of positive labelling, to help consumers make informed choices when grocery shopping. It indicates products as healthier options as compared with other products within the same category. The HCS has stringent criteria and strict guidelines which must be adhered to by companies applying for the HCS.\n\nBesides a rigorous application process, HPB\u2019s HCS programme is also regularly reviewed so that it remains relevant to consumers\u2019 consumption patterns, and wider health needs and priorities.\n\nBeverages carrying the HCS contain at least 25% less sugar, as compared with regular products in the same category. All HCS malted or chocolate drinks contain less than or equal to 6g per 100g of added sugar, which is relatively lower in sugar compared to many other malted drinks in the market.\n\nMarketing has reached out to Nestle Singapore for comments on whether the MILO powder in Singapore will be affected.\n\nThis news comes as Nestle Malaysia recently defended its MILO product, following two viral videos from Malaysian entrepreneur Vishen Lakhiani who criticised Nestle for marketing its MILO brand product as healthy one, while disputing its benefits and nutritional value. The videos also claim that MILO is made up of 40% sugar.\n\nNestle clarified that MILO comprises 40% sugar, but that was only in its raw form before dilution.

and beverages consumption market, is expected to register RM400 million in sales this year as a result of new product launches.\n\nHofbauer said the company has targeted to launch between 40 and 50 new products this year, including for the on-the-go consumption segment, which consists mainly of confectionery and culinary products.\n\nThe targeted RM400 million in sales would represent approximately 10% of Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia\u2019s domestic sales target.\n\nLast year, Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia garnered RM380 million in sales from new products introduced in 2017.\n\nDomestic consumption currently contributes about 80% of Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia\u2019s sales, while the remaining 20% is from the export market.\n\n\u201cWe export to over 50 countries, including the Middle East and South-East Asia,\u201d he said, adding that the export value constitutes about RM1 billion.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Malaysia manufactures and markets more than 500 halal products globally.\n\nHofbauer said the company is cautiously optimistic of achieving earnings growth for its current financial year ending Dec 31, 2018, with projected improvement in profit margin amid declining prices of commodities and

Its dairy divisions in Malaysia and Thailand should benefit from falling milk prices since the second half of 2017 (2H17).\n\nGiven the recent valuation rerating at Nestle (M) Bhd and the big discount gap, F&N is a laggard play.\n\nExcluding restructuring costs, we estimate that F&N\u2019s beverage division charted a 60% year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) to RM28 million in the financial year ended Sept 30, 2017 (FY17), on the back of higher sugar prices (sugar accounts for 30% of cost of goods sold [COGS]) and aggressive discounting amid intense competition.\n\nWe believe the worst should be over for the beverage division as there is ample room for cost savings following the completion of the merger between Dairies Malaysia and Soft Drinks Malaysia, resulting in a leaner structure, as well margin improvement on lower sugar prices (down 5% to 10%) this year.\n\nA potential hike in beverage prices will improve margins further, although we note that there is no such plan at this juncture.\n\nSkimmed milk accounts for 45% of F&N\u2019s COGS and global prices of skimmed milk powder are currently hovering at US$1,700/tonne from 2H17\u2019s high of US$2,000/tonne in July 2017. Although F&N\u2019s dairy division in both Malaysia and Thailand saw margin compression in the fourth quarter of financial year 2017 (4QFY17) due to higher locked-in milk prices, we expect margins to recover from 2HFY18 on lower locked-in milk prices.\n\nWe see F&N as a laggard play versus its bigger peer Nestle, which is trading at 35 times 2018 price-earnings (PE), representing a big discount gap of 35%. Based on the five-year 12-month forward PE, the average discount of F&N versus Nestle was 20%.\n\nIn addition, we note that its smaller peer Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd with less than half of F&N\u2019s earnings base is trading at 26 times 2018 PE, according to consensus estimates.\n\nSoft Drinks Malaysia had a lacklustre FY17 with a 15% y-o-y decline in top line and an estimated 60% y-o-y drop in Ebit (excluding restructuring costs).\n\nDespite an estimated 10% y-o-y drop in sales volume for FY18, we expect earnings to recover on cost savings from the recent restructuring as well as lower sugar prices this year. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that for every 10% change in sugar prices from our base assumption, our FY18 to FY20 net profit forecasts for F&N will be impacted by 6%.\n\nWe are still hopeful of a recovery in sales volume on market share gain as we gather that major competitors in the soft drink industry recently ended their steep price discounting campaign after raising average selling prices by more than 20%.\n\nGiven that Dairies Malaysia is operating at full utilisation, it plans to expand capacity at its Pulau Indah plant for de-bottlenecking. In Thailand, it has completed installing an evaporation line in Rojana and bought gable top filing machines in Pak Chong.\n\nThe plan to install a sweetened condensed milk pouch and tube filling line in Rojana are under way. Not least, the dairy division will also benefit from the recent downtrend in milk prices. For every 10% change in skimmed milk powder prices from our base assumption, our FY18 to FY20 net profit forecasts for F&N will be impacted by 8% to 9%.\n\nThe bulk of the restructuring costs of RM48.4 million for FY17 were due to the reduction in staff count from the merger of Dairies Malaysia and Soft Drinks Malaysia. The merger will see simplified processes and a leaner structure that minimises duplications and increases efficiencies.\n\nThe group targets sustainable operating expenditure (opex) savings of more than RM40 million per annum on the back of a lower staff count, automation and savings from its new warehouse, which is in the midst of completion.\n\nWe raise our FY18 to FY20 net profit forecasts by 9.6%, 5.7% and 5.5% respectively after updating our key assumptions.\n\nA key risk includes the introduction of sugar tax.\n\nOur TP is based on 26 times 2019 PE (from 21 times), or a 25% discount to Nestle\u2019s 12-month forward PE of 35 times.\n\nF&N is trading at a discount of 35% to Nestle following the recent valuation rerating at Nestle on the back of Nestle\u2019s inclusion into the FBM KLCI in December 2017.\n\nIf F&N earnings outperform on the back of contributions from its upcoming capacities and margin improvement from sustained strategic cost savings post-merger, it will see simplified processes and a leaner structure that minimises duplications and increases efficiencies.\n\nThe group targets sustainable opex savings of more than RM40 million per annum on the back of a lower staff count, automation and savings from its new warehouse, which is in the midst of completion.\n\nWe raise our FY18 to FY20 net profit forecasts by 9.6%, 5.7% and 5.5% respectively after updating our key assumptions.\n\nA key risk includes the introduction of sugar tax.\n\nOur TP is based on 26 times 2019 PE (from 21 times), or a 25% discount to Nestle\u2019s 12-month forward PE of 35 times.\n\nF&N is trading at a discount of 35% to Nestle following the recent valuation rerating at Nestle on the back of Nestle\u2019s inclusion into the FBM KLCI in December 2017.\n\nIf F&N\u2019s earnings outperform on the back of contribution from its upcoming capacities and margin improvement from sustained strategic cost savings post-merger between Dairies Malaysia and Soft Drinks Malaysia, its valuation gap with Nestle could narrow from current levels. F&N has a dividend policy of a minimum 50% payout. In FY13 to FY15, the group paid out more than 70% of its earnings. However, we note that FY16 to FY17 headline payouts fell to 55% and 65% respectively (with absolute dividend per share [DPS] maintained at 57.5 sen) mainly to fund capital expenditure for new projects. Hence, our conservative payout assumption of 55% for FY18 to FY20 represents yields of 2.5% to 2.8%. \u2014 UOB Kay Hian, Jan 5", "date": "01-07-2018", "url": "http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/worst-over-fraser-neaves-beverage-division", "authors": [], "summary": "Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd(Jan 5, RM27.82)Upgrade to buy with a higher target price (TP) of RM33: The worst is over for Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd\u2019s (F&N) beverage division as it reaps cost savings from the merger between the dairy and soft drink divisions, and lower sugar prices this year.\nIts dairy divisions in Malaysia and Thailand should benefit from falling milk prices since the second half of 2017 (2H17).\nExcluding restructuring costs, we estimate that F&N\u2019s beverage division charted a 60% year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) to RM28 million in the financial year ended Sept 30, 2017 (FY17), on the back of higher sugar prices (sugar accounts for 30% of cost of goods sold [COGS]) and aggressive discounting amid intense competition.\nAlthough F&N\u2019s dairy division in both Malaysia and Thailand saw margin compression in the fourth quarter of financial year 2017 (4QFY17) due to higher locked-in milk prices, we expect margins to recover from 2HFY18 on lower locked-in milk prices.\nNot least, the dairy division will also benefit from the recent downtrend in milk prices.", "news": "The Edge Markets MY"}, {"title": "Consumer stocks top performers, Nestle, F&N record highs, foreign funds net buyers - Business News", "keyword": ["funds", "highs", "fell", "fresh", "fn", "rose", "stocks", "nestle", "shares", "higher", "foreign", "shed", "performers", "sime", "net", "consumer", "record", "volume"], "top-image": "http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2017/04/17/04/33/bull-market-march2017.ashx/?w=620&h=413&crop=1&hash=B5B1368C00814552F3BAF2AD41C79507ECAFDDC1", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Consumer stocks continued their strong performance on Tuesday, with Nestle \u2013 which is part of the FBM KLCI \u2013 surging to fresh record high, and other stocks riding on the bullish sentiment.\n\n\n\nAt 5pm, the KLCI was up 2.81 points or 0.15% to 1,864.03.

We believe that Nestle should see higher revenue growth in FY18 supported by improvement in consumer sentiment and higher disposable income spurred by the strengthening of the ringgit and a favourable Budget 2018. Nestle\u2019s continuous effort to launch new products should also help sustain its growth in tandem with the 4% to 5% growth in food and beverages (F&B) packaged food sales value in Malaysia. We are forecasting 16% earnings per share (EPS) growth on revenue and margin improvement.\n\n\n\nThe gross margin in 2017 declined by 2.7 percentage points (ppts) to 36.7% (versus 39.4% in 2016), mainly due to the higher raw material price hedged in the first half of 2017 (1H17) when raw material prices were still at elevated levels. Nevertheless, we saw quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) recovery in gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 (4Q17). In light of the decline in the prices of key raw materials in 2H17, we expect sequential improvement in gross margin as Nestle\u2019s raw material cost usually lags four to six months, due to hedging contracts. We forecast 2018 gross margin to improve to 39%. Recent strength in the ringgit against the US dollar is also positive for Nestle given that about 50% of its raw materials are imported.\n\nWe leave our FY18 estimate (FY18E) to FY20E earnings per share (EPS) unchanged, but change our valuation methodology from the dividend discount model (DDM) to discounted cash flow (DCF) to better reflect its earnings prospects in the medium term. As a result, we revise up our TP to RM97.60, which implies a price-earnings ratio of 30 times FY18E EPS. We maintain our \u201csell\u201d rating on Nestle because we think that the current valuation of 39 times FY18E EPS (historical high) is overly stretched. While we still like Nestle for its solid brand name and the defensiveness of its business, we deem the 5% to 6% average earnings growth and dividend yield of 2% to 3% as unattractive for such valuation. \u2014 Affin Hwang Capital Research, March 5", "date": "03-05-2018", "url": "http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/nestle-expected-see-higher-revenue-growth-fy18", "authors": [], "summary": "Nestle (M) Bhd(March 5, RM127.90)Maintain sell with a higher target price (TP) of RM97.60: During a recent briefing, Nestle (M) Bhd guided that financial year 2017\u2019s (FY17) revenue growth of 4% year-on-year (y-o-y) was mainly driven by volume growth.\nWe believe that Nestle should see higher revenue growth in FY18 supported by improvement in consumer sentiment and higher disposable income spurred by the strengthening of the ringgit and a favourable Budget 2018.\nWe are forecasting 16% earnings per share (EPS) growth on revenue and margin improvement.\nNevertheless, we saw quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) recovery in gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 (4Q17).\nWe forecast 2018 gross margin to improve to 39%.", "news": "The Edge Markets MY"}, {"title": "Nestle Malaysia Delivers 100% ROE in Consumer Staples", "keyword": ["consumer", "100", "products", "nestle", "growth", "delivers", "staples", "brands", "nesz", "milk", "currently", "ranked", "university", "roe", "berhad"], "top-image": "https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chocolate_1524798770.jpg", "text": "Background\n\nNestle (Malaysia) Berhad is a food and beverage manufacturer and distributor in Malaysia and internationally.\n\nGet The Timeless Reading eBook in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Timeless Reading in PDF.

This creates more demand for manufactured goods, which make up the lion\u2019s share of the country\u2019s exports. It also helps power economic growth and had made Malaysia the world\u2019s 24th largest exporter in 2016, accounting for 1.2% of global exports, according to data from the World Trade Organisation.\n\nElectrical and electronic (E&E) products continue to be the main pillar of the country\u2019s exports as well as the manufacturing sector, which contributed 23% to Malaysia\u2019s GDP growth in 2016. E&E exports rose 20.5% year on year to RM314.27 billion in the first 11 months of 2017, making up 36.7% of total exports.\n\nCarsem (M) Sdn Bhd (part of the Hong Leong group\u2019s Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd), Unisem (M) Bhd, SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd (under Khazanah Nasional Bhd), Inari Technology Bhd (wholly-owned subsidiary of Inari Amertron Bhd), Dominant Opto Technologies Sdn Bhd (subsidiary of D&O Green Technologies Bhd) and Globetronics (Technology Bhd) Group are the six local E&E companies listed on the website of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti).\n\nThe top 10 E&E multinational corporations in Malaysia are Western Digital Group, Panasonic Group, Intel Group, Samsung Group, Flextronics, HP Malaysia Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, Dyson Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, First Solar Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Infineon Group and OSRAM Opto Semiconductors Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Miti\u2019s website shows at the time of writing.\n\nHelped by the availability of oil and gas as feedstock and a strong base of supporting services, the chemical and petrochemical subsector is the second largest contributor to exports. Exports of petroleum products rose 34.7% year on year to RM65.85 billion in January-November 2017 while exports of chemical and chemical products rose 28% year on year to RM62.59 billion.\n\nPetronas Chemicals Group Bhd leads the pack of major petrochemical players in Malaysia, with the others being Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd, BASF Petronas Chemicals Sdn Bhd, Idemitsu Chemicals and Toray Plastics, Miti\u2019s data shows.\n\nThe major oleochemical players are Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd\u2019s KLK Oleo, IOI Oleochemicals (a subsidiary of IOI Corp Bhd), Sime Darby Plantation Bhd and Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd while the leading players in other speciality oleochemicals are CCM Chemicals Sdn Bhd (under Chemical Company of Malaysia Bhd), Synthomer Sdn Bhd (Synthomer PLC is UK-listed) and Taiko (under KLK).\n\nA number of these companies are oil palm planters that also contribute to exports of palm oil and palm-based agricultural products, which reached RM49.75 billion in January-November 2017, up 13.4% from the previous corresponding period.\n\nMiti also counts the following companies as some of the major players in the plastics industry: Scientex Bhd, V.S. Industry Bhd, Thong Guan Industries Bhd, BP Plastics Holding Bhd and Tomypak Holdings Bhd.\n\nAnother sizeable export contributor is the machinery and equipment (M&E) subsector, whose growth is helped by sales of air conditioners and specialised products for the oil and gas exploration and production industry as well as parts for sinking and boring machinery.\n\nCiting data from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida), Miti\u2019s list of top five Malaysian M&E manufacturers are ViTrox Technologies Sdn Bhd (a unit of Vitrox Corp Bhd), SRM Integration (M) Sdn Bhd, Alliance Contract Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, Alpha Precision Turning & Engineering Sdn Bhd and KNM Process Systems Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of KNM Group Bhd).\n\nThe top five foreign M&E manufacturers are Asiaflex Products (from France, in Johor), FMC Technologies (from the US, in Johor), SKF Bearing (from Sweden, in Negeri Sembilan), Aker Solutions (from Norway, in Selangor) and Schlumberger Seismic Manufacturing (from the US, in Penang).\n\nIt is worth noting that Malaysia made 3.8 million air-conditioning units in January-November 2017, more than the 2.68 million units produced in the whole of 2016 and above the 2.91 million units produced in the whole of 2014. Some of these probably come from Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia Bhd\u2019s 40%-owned associate company, Panasonic Malaysia Sdn Bhd, whose electrical appliance-making plant in Shah Alam can reportedly make 3.1 million air conditioners for the local and export markets every year.\n\nLeading natural and synthetic rubber glove makers, such as Top Glove Corp Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and Supermax Corp Bhd, also likely contributed to export growth as did home-grown condom-maker Karex Bhd.\n\nBetween January and November 2017, Malaysia exported 661.9 tonnes of rubber gloves \u2014 8.4% more than the 610.51 tonnes exported in the first 11 months of 2016 \u2014 according to data from the Department of Statistics Malaysia. The value of these glove exports rose to RM14.59 billion, up 22.1% from the previous corresponding period. This could be a reflection of Malaysian products selling at better margins or prices, coupled with an attractive ringgit to US dollar exchange rate for purchasers.\n\nDue to their production of surgical and examination gloves, Top Glove Sdn Bhd and Kossan Latex Industries (M) Sdn Bhd are on Miti\u2019s list of major local companies in the medical device industry. Other local companies listed are ABio Orthopaedics Sdn Bhd, Straits Orthopaedics (Mfg) Sdn Bhd, Vigilenz Medical Devices Sdn Bhd, Granulab (M) Sdn Bhd, Hospitech Manufacturing Services Sdn Bhd and OSA Technology Sdn Bhd.\n\nLarge local pharmaceutical companies listed by Miti are Pharmaniaga Manufacturing Bhd, CCM Pharmaceuticals Sdn Bhd, Hovid Bhd, Kotra Pharma (M) Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of Kotra Industries Bhd), Xepa-Soul Pattinson (M) Sdn Bhd and Ain Medicare Sdn Bhd.\n\nMost of the companies mentioned above contribute to the economy and export growth in varying degrees.\n\nA quick search on Bloomberg for companies that derive more than 50% of their top line from outside Malaysia yielded 179. These are not all exporters as a number of them have overseas earnings. Some of the companies mentioned above are among the 179.\n\nApart from the usual list of key exporters among the semiconductor and tech companies, glove makers and planters, companies with sizeable export sales and earnings listed on Bursa Malaysia likely include Nestl\u00e9 (M) Bhd, which is the largest producer of halal products within Nestl\u00e9 Group globally and exports halal products to at least 51 countries, its 2016 annual report says.\n\nFraser & Neave Holdings Bhd also supports Malaysia\u2019s development as a global commercial and halal hub, telling shareholders in its 2017 annual report that it had further expanded its export market network in the global Muslim market, where the company\u2019s halal certification carries added leverage. Its products are already exported to 55 countries worldwide with its top exports being condensed milk in cans, 2.5kg pouch packs and 20kg bag-in-box for industrial customers. The export revenue of dairy products from Malaysia rose 26% in FY2017 and the company told shareholders in its latest annual report that it \u201cis confident that through [its] transformation programme, [it] will be able to maximise growth opportunities for exports from Malaysia to surpass its RM500 million sales target ahead of 2020\u201d.\n\nHere is a snapshot of The Edge\u2019s choice of 15 companies to watch for sizeable export contribution today and possibly in the years to come.\n\nGlobetronics Technology\n\nThis Penang-based outsourced semiconductor assembly and test company piqued investors\u2019 interest for its strong position in the US smartphone customer supply chain. Globetronics\u2019 sensor products include those for light, gesture and 3D imaging. It is expected to benefit from Apple\u2019s adoption of the TrueDepth camera system for 3D sensing and facial recognition, rumoured to be among key features for several new iPhone models this year.\n\nHartalega\n\nThe world\u2019s No 1 nitrile glove maker invested RM2.2 billion in a next-generation integrated glove manufacturing complex in Sepang in 2014 to boost capacity from 14 billion to 42 billion. Its new product, a \u201cnon-leaching anti-microbial glove\u201d that is said to kill 99.99% of germs within five minutes of contact, could rake in more business once the company obtains the necessary approvals. Thanks to China\u2019s anti-pollution drive, Hartalega\u2019s gloves are sold out through April.\n\nInari Amertron\n\nInari Amertron, which counts global chip giant Broadcom Ltd as its single largest customer, is expected to see strong demand at its radio frequency division, given the proliferation of RF content in smartphones to support the faster 4G LTE speed. It has to stay lean as Penang-born Tan Hock Eng, who heads Broadcom, is known to be a cost-cutter. Growth could also come from infrared LED for Osram (Inari Optical Technologies) and the mixed signal testing division (under Inari Integrated System).\n\nIOI Corp\n\nThe integrated oil palm planter with over 207,000ha of planted estate in Malaysia and Indonesia entered a new epoch when it sold 70% of its speciality fats producer, IOI Loders Croklaan, to global grains trader Bunge Ltd for US$946 million. While IOI keeps only a 30% stake, IOI Loders would benefit from Bunge\u2019s expertise and network in over 40 countries. The proceeds will come in handy for future expansion.\n\nKESM Industries\n\nThe world\u2019s largest independent burn-in and test service company KESM does not make chips but has shipped about a billion burn-in and test devices to its customers \u2014 semiconductor companies. Although it does not directly export products, KESM is a company to watch as it supports and sells to exporters and works closely with top semiconductor firms. Its aggressive capital expenditure into the automotive burn-in and test business could rake in returns from the growth of autonomous and smarter vehicles.\n\nKuala Lumpur Kepong\n\nOne of the largest oil palm estate owners in the business, KLK has land bank of over 270,000ha in Malaysia (41%), Indonesia (51%) and Liberia (8%). Rubber estates make up about 7% of the planted area \u2014 the largest among Malaysia-listed planters.

It is also a leading player in polypropylene strapping bands in Asia, and a leading producer of other industrial packaging products.\n\nTop Glove Corp\n\nAlready the world\u2019s largest (latex) rubber glove maker, Top Glove is actively looking for acquisition targets that would complement its product mix or help it have better control over costs. A beneficiary of the recent surge in demand for rubber gloves, Top Glove, which also has plants in China, is maintaining its annual 8% to 10% capacity growth target. Its recent RM1.37 billion purchase of surgical glove maker, Aspion Sdn Bhd, has solidified its top position in the global market.\n\nUCHI Technologies\n\nThis Penang-based producer of electronic control modules for coffee machines is riding its European customers\u2019 love for coffee and the high-end contraptions that make them.

high\n\nBy DASHVEENJIT KAUR / Pic By MUHD AMIN NAHARUL\n\nFast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant Nestl\u00e9 Malaysia Bhd\u2019s market capitalisation has doubled in the past 12 months to RM33.25 billion as it became the most expensive stock on the local exchange at RM150 a share last Friday.\n\nThe local unit of multinational Nestl\u00e9 SA has become the 14th most valuable company on Bursa Malaysia on expectations it is set to benefit from higher consumer demand and lower operational costs from the stronger ringgit.\n\nAnalysts are, however, warning the stock valuations are now on the high side and suspect to a correction to more fundamentally reasonable levels.\n\nKenanga Investment Bank Bhd has a \u2018Market Perform\u2019 call on Nestl\u00e9 with a target price of RM114.30 based on a revised price-earnings ratio (PER) of 32 times.\n\nKenanga analyst Clement Chua said going forward, it appears commodity prices will likely ease.\n\n\u201cThe surge in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s share prices is likely attributed by the inclusion of the stock into the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI) component stocks in December 2017.\n\n\u201cWhile valuations appear to be more expensive resulting from this, we believe the short-term sentiment may keep the stock at present level due to its marketing leading position and resilient presence in the market,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Nestl\u00e9 now trades at 53.5 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS) and 48 times its estimates for the coming year.\n\nThat\u2019s double the ratio of much of the previous five years; only late in 2017 did its valuation break above 30 times EPS.\n\nNestl\u00e9\u2019s share price has returned 43% year-to-date and about 20% in the past month alone.\n\nNestl\u00e9 kick-started 2018 with 37 gains in 44 trading days, for a 53% rise \u2014 easily the best in the country\u2019s benchmark index.\n\nThe share price performance has outshone its big-cap peers and on March 13, 2018, it rose to a record high of RM157.40.\n\nAnalysts and investors favour Nestl\u00e9 for its solid brand name and defensive business prospects.\n\nAffin Hwang Capital Research expects Nestl\u00e9\u2019s 2018 earnings to be stronger on a recovery in consumer spending, lower materials costs and the strengthening of the ringgit.\n\nNestl\u00e9\u2019s share price is well above Affin Hwang\u2019s target price of RM97.60, or 30 times its 2018 EPS forecast.\n\nAffin Hwang expects Nestl\u00e9\u2019s continuous effort to launch new products would help sustain growth in tandem with the 4% to 5% growth forecast for the food and beverage packaged food sales value in Malaysia.\n\nIt forecasts a 16% EPS growth on revenue and margin improvement.\n\nTo recall, Nestl\u00e9 recorded its highest fourth-quarter net profit of RM133.54 million in 2017 due to sustained cost management and phasing of its marketing investments in 2017.\n\nIts quarterly revenue rose 2.4% year-on-year (YoY) to RM1.28 billion from RM1.25 billion in 2016.\n\nFull-year turnover was higher by 3.9% YoY at RM5.26 billion, as earnings rose 1.4% YoY to RM645.8 million.\n\nCIMB Research analyst Kristine Wong has lifted Nestl\u00e9\u2019s financial year of 2018 (FY18) to FY19 EPS by 0.8% to 0.9%.\n\nCIMB also raised its 12-month discounted cashflow-based target price for Nestl\u00e9 to RM97.40 as it reduced its beta assumption, given the lowered risks after the stock\u2019s inclusion to the index last year.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to like its defensive business model, strong brand name and huge consumer base, we think its valuations are stretched at FY18/FY19F to 41 times/38 times respectively, to the PE.\u201d\n\n\u201cIts FY18 to FY20 dividend yields are also unappealing at an estimated 2.3% to 2.7%,\u201d Wong added.\n\nAny significant spike in cost of raw materials, such as milk powder, sugar and coffee beans are potential de-rating catalysts, while upside risks to CIMB\u2019s call include better than expected export demand and a substantial recovery in domestic spending.\n\nMIDF Amanah Investment Bhd analyst Nabil Zainoodin maintained a \u2018Neutral\u2019 rating with a revised target price of RM116.50.\n\nHe concurred its valuation is currently stretched with a forward PER of more than 40 times compared to the average three-year PE of 28 times before the inclusion in both the indexes (MSCI Malaysia Index and FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI) last year.\n\n\u201cWe believe the improved earnings in the 4Q17 and expectation of better earnings in FY18 have been priced into the current valuation,\u201d he added.\n\nNabil expects earnings to improve due to stable top line growth on better consumer sentiment and spending because of government measures to increase household disposable income, with the stronger ringgit helping to stabilise cost of input materials, and better efficiency.\n\nThe stronger ringgit, however, might taper export growth while the higher effective tax rate of 20% given the increasing deferred tax liabilities.\n\nHong Leong Investment Bhd analyst Gan Huan Wen expects Nestl\u00e9 to benefit from a recovery in consumer spending in 2018 aided by the pre-election cash handouts.\n\nGan likes Nestl\u00e9 for its defensive nature, diversified product portfolio and stellar management.\n\n\u201cDespite

What is even more impressive is that during the last one year, about 22.5% or 207 of the companies listed on Bursa Malaysia have touched their all-time highs while about 50% of these companies recorded new highs this year.\n\nA look at companies on Bursa reveals that there is another set of companies \u2014 making up 20% of listed counters \u2014 that has been overlooked after hitting record highs between 2013 and 2015. Notably, oil price collapsed in mid-2014.\n\nRecall that the Malaysian stock market saw a sharp decline following the collapse of crude oil prices, with the FBM KLCI falling to its five-year low of 1,532.14 in August 2015. However, despite the strong recovery in the FBM KLCI, most of these companies that hit their all-time highs before the oil price collapse are still lagging far behind, by an average of 47.5%.\n\nSome analysts believe that some of these counters could see a gradual recovery, especially the oil and gas (O&G) players, given the rally in oil prices recently.\n\nAbel Goon, an analyst with TA Securities, told The Edge Financial Daily that a sustained level in oil price will benefit some of the O&G counters on Bursa, especially if it translates into higher capital expenditure (capex) among O&G majors.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Malaysian stock market, a lot of the oil and gas counters are related to services and will not benefit directly from the increase in the oil prices. If oil prices can sustain at this level and encourage capex, it will lead to more activities for players like UMW Oil and Gas Corp Bhd, Sapura Energy Bhd and others,\u201d Goon explained.\n\nHe pointed out that counters like Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd and Dagang NeXchange Bhd could benefit directly from the rise in oil prices.\n\nRakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau concurred, pointing out that sentiment in the O&G industry has definitely improved as seen by the share price rally in some of the counters such as Sapura Energy.\n\nOther laggards such as Malaysia Building Society Bhd (MBSB), which is now a full-fledged Islamic bank, could also benefit as there are not a lot of Islamic bank counters available on the exchange, he noted. MBSB closed at RM1.15, which is about 50.9% off its all-time high of RM2.34 recorded in 2013.\n\nOther sectors such as telecommunications could also see a return of interest among investors if they can sustain earnings amid a competitive environment.\n\nWhile telcos may still need time to prove themselves, Lau said recent adjustments made to their products to stay ahead of competition were not done at the expense of the players\u2019 existing pricing, which is a positive for the sector. Maxis Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd are on average about 18% below their all-time highs.\n\nFor other past winners, it remains uncertain if they can regain their former glory. For example, British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd (BAT Malaysia) has fallen by 60.6% from its all-time high of RM63 recorded in 2014.\n\nFor its financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY14), BAT Malaysia posted a revenue of RM18.6 billion and a net income of about RM902.9 million. Its latest set of financials for FY17 paled in comparison as group revenue fell by more than half to RM7.1 billion while net profit fell by 44.6% to RM500 million.\n\nThe performers\n\nAs for the 207 companies that touched their all-time highs in the last one year, most of them have benefited from the oil price collapse, a weak ringgit as well as the many mega infrastructure projects that were announced.\n\nInfrastructure projects that were announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak (now caretaker prime minister) have spurred most of the construction players that were awarded contracts related to most of the infrastructure projects. Gamuda Bhd, Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd, George Kent (Malaysia) Bhd and Ekovest Bhd were some of the companies that saw strong growth during this time, which also coincided with the rally in their share prices.\n\nExporters of semiconductors, gloves, consumer products and furniture benefited from the weak ringgit at the time. Strong demand for electrical and electronic goods has also benefited Malaysia\u2019s semiconductor industry.\n\nThe banking sector also saw a recovery from some of the impairment losses that were recorded when oil prices collapsed and are back on investors\u2019 radar as seen by the recent strong performance in their share prices and positive financial results.\n\nBut with such a strong uptrend seen in the last three years, questions over the sustainability of this good run begin to surface. Apple Inc\u2019s main chip supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co last week lowered its second-quarter revenue guidance on softer smartphone demand and uncertainty over the cryptocurrency mining market, leading to a decline in the share prices of semiconductor players.\n\nIt is worth noting that semiconductor-related players on Bursa were one of the main ones that hit new highs in the last one year \u2014 most of them early this year or late last year.

It is worth noting that most of these recent highs were recorded in the first quarter this year.

Global markets barely recovered before being hit by fears of technology regulation and a US-China trade war.\n\nAlthough the benchmark FBM KLCI climbed 3.71% in January and foreign investors were net buyers for 10 out of the past 13 weeks, the broader market recorded negative returns for 582 stocks out of a total of 984 listed companies in the quarter.\n\nOnly 150 counters showed gains and the standouts were none other than consumer stocks, which are traditionally seen as defensive plays due to expectations that they will generate stable returns even in uncertain times. Investors appeared to have flocked to the sector throughout 1Q18, sending the Consumer Product Index up 9.03% in 1Q18, outperforming the FBM KLCI\u2019s 4.11% rise.\n\nThe biggest gainer among the Consumer Product Index\u2019s constituent stocks as at March 31, 2018 was Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, which outstripped the rest of the gainers with a 51.3% increase in share price to RM154.50, giving it RM36.25 billion in market value. Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd, the second-largest gainer, saw its share price rise 6.67% over the three months.\n\nOther consumer stocks that outdid the wider market were Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, and Heineken Malaysia Bhd.\n\nOn the other hand, most other sectors on Bursa Malaysia declined in 1Q18, with technology stocks taking the biggest hit by falling 22.36%. Also recording large declines were counters in the real estate investment trust sector, property and small capitalisation segment.\n\nDanny Wong, chief executive officer of Areca Capital, pointed out that the selldown of tech stocks worldwide were mostly because they had hit high valuations. Notably, in the US, the Nasdaq Composite index rallied early this year to a then-record high of 7,505.77 points on Jan 26 before losing 9.71% over the course of two weeks as analysts warned that the sector had run ahead of fundamentals.\n\nThe decline in share prices could be an opportunity for investors however, with the \u201cbuy the dip\u201d philosophy, still making its rounds.\n\n\u201cNow is a good time to accumulate shares in small- and mid-cap stocks,\u201d Kenny Yee, head of research at Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd, told The Edge Financial Daily.\n\nHe said the construction and manufacturing sectors could be the ones to keep an eye on for value even as opportunities are present across the board. However, Yee pointed out that the prices of blue chips have not weakened by much despite an overall decline in the market.\n\nAreca\u2019s Wong also viewed the market\u2019s correction as a positive event and suggested that this makes room for another rally.\n\n\u201cIf the global growth story continues, corporate earnings should improve,\u201d he said, noting that proxies to strong economic growth such as banking stocks could continue to benefit despite having already made considerable gains.\n\nDividend stocks are also a good bet, Wong added, as the drop in share prices and year-on-year growth in corporate earnings may drive dividend yields higher.\n\nA possible dampener on the local front, however, is that the 14th general election presents a key uncertainty to investors, he said. Investor sentiment will also depend on international trade negotiations, although a full trade war is not expected.\n\nRakuten\u2019s Yee also considered the trend of US-China relations as likely to continue causing volatility in the market.

Last year\u2019s US$425mil purchase of a stake in Blue Bottle Coffee was a step back into the segment, whose growth prospects have revived as consumers become more sophisticated about coffee.\n\nWhile Starbucks holds the crown in the US$13.8bil US coffee market, Nescafe and Nespresso hold the top ranks globally, according to Euromonitor. Starbucks has been examining each of its businesses to streamline its operations and focus on those that add most to sales and profit, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said on a conference call in January.\n\nNestle also added niche brand Chameleon Cold-Brew last year to expand its portfolio in the US. Nespresso also introduced a machine that\u2019s more attuned to Americans\u2019 preference for bigger cups of joe several years ago.

The benchmark index fell by 9.23% in the second quarter (2Q) of this year as uncertainties sparked large outflows among foreign investors following the country\u2019s 14th general election that saw a change in government for the first time since independence.\n\nNonetheless, despite the decline, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee told The Edge Financial Daily that the second half could see the FBM KLCI rebounding as the selldown is deemed to be overdone.\n\n\u201cIndex-related counters are ripe for pickings following the recent selldown,\u201d Yee said.\n\nYee\u2019s view is supported by the consensus target prices (TPs) for the component stocks of the FBM KLCI. The index component stocks have an average potential return of 11.3% over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Only four component stocks have lower TPs than their last closing prices while only one is not tracked by analysts.\n\nAxiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Genting Bhd are the top three companies with the highest potential returns of 43.98%, 36.82% and 36.10% respectively. Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd is not tracked by any analyst while Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, KLCCP Stapled Group and PPB Group Bhd appeared to be trading above analysts\u2019 average TPs.\n\nIt is also worth noting that preliminary trading data last Friday showed that net buying emerged among foreign investors for the first time since May 2, bringing the foreign fund outflow to a halt after 37 consecutive days of selling.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced especially with so much uncertainties still on the horizon.\n\n\u201cI think what we are seeing now is the window-dressing activities for the first half of the year. It\u2019s not something that is sustainable especially given the environment that we are in today,\u201d an analyst said.\n\nHe added that the uncertainties are coming from both domestic and external fronts.\n\n\u201cIf you look internally, we need to look at what the new government will propose. It\u2019ll be the first 100 days since they took office soon and Pakatan Harapan will be under immense pressure to fulfil most of its promises during the election campaign. There is also the introduction of SST (sales and services tax), the revised budget 2018 and budget 2019. Let\u2019s not forget about the removal of some of the management teams at some of the GLCs (government-linked companies). All of these create uncertainties and the market dislikes that,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the external front, he pointed to the escalation of trade tension between the US and China as well as other developed economies such as the European Union as a concern.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see the implementation of the trade tariffs on July 6. While the market has started to price in some of these impact from the trade tariffs, a full-blown trade war could see a sharper decline in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nLoui Low, head of retail research at Hong Leong Investment Bank, also agreed that it is too early to expect a rebound in the market as the current development remains mildly negative for the stock market.\n\n\u201cWe believe that recovery should be seen in the fourth quarter as there are still a lot of uncertainties in the third quarter,\u201d Low said.\n\nHe added that foreign funds have been selling the market consistently since May 2 with a total of RM10.79 billion sold off as at last Thursday.

The large retailers they sell through face their own pressure to keep prices down, as they battle new competition from drug stores and Amazon.com.\n\nThe result has been mounting tension, which recently erupted in a clash between Nestle and European retailers that saw some of the Swiss company's goods briefly taken off store shelves. That row was itself an echo of a 2016 standoff between Unilever and British supermarket giant Tesco.\n\nOn Thursday, results from both manufacturers suggested those tensions remain high. Nestle's 2.8% underlying sales growth only got a 0.2% boost from higher prices, and Unilever's 3.4% growth just a 0.1% lift.\n\n\"We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market's fears of weak pricing power, fuelled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities (prices),\" Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said.\n\nThe pricing pressure was even tougher for U.S. giant Procter & Gamble, which on Thursday reported just a 1% rise in underlying quarterly sales growth.\n\nThat included a 2% hit from lower prices, offset by higher volumes and other factors. The maker of Gillette razors cut some prices last year, amid competition from subscription-based rivals such as Dollar Shave Club, owned by Unilever, and Harry's.\n\nUnilever shares were down 2%, while Nestle's were up 0.3%, as investors looked past the pricing issue at the Swiss food giant to the fact its overall sales exceeded expectations, after several disappointing quarters.\n\nThat beat, and a pick-up in volume, is welcome news for Nestle's new CEO Mark Schneider, who took the top job at the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soups in 2017, with the mission to return it to solid growth after six years of decline.\n\nSchneider said underlying growth would improve during 2018.\n\nConsumer sentiment in Europe, as measured by researchers GfK, declined in March to a reading of 20.6 points, from 21.1 points in December.\n\n\"The mood of European consumers is proving to be rather less optimistic in the first quarter of 2018 than at the end of last year,\" the group said on Thursday. \"In France and Austria, in particular, the euphoria appears to have diminished temporarily in the wake of the elections.\"\n\nWaning pricing power?\n\nConsumer goods makers and retailers are always in complex negotiations around pricing and promotions to suit their ambitions. If a manufacturer wants to take market share, it might discount, or seek price increases to boost margins.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said trends suggested Unilever and some of its peers had \"blinked a little\" on pricing due to growing competition, even though they represent powerful, established brands.\n\n\"Brands are still a vital part of any company's pricing power armoury but ... some companies are stronger in the food chain than others, depending on size, route to market and the availability of alternatives,\" Mould said.\n\nNestle and Unilever are two of the world's biggest packaged goods companies, with the Swiss giant home to Gerber baby food and Perrier water, and its Anglo-Dutch rival the company behind Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream.\n\nThis is Unilever's second quarter of volume-led sales growth, after several quarters fueled by pricing. Finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said the earlier price rises, and corresponding weak volume, were partly due to currency-related inflationary pressures in certain markets that have since abated, giving consumers more confidence to spend on everyday items.\n\nAs a result, sales volume in emerging markets, where Unilever does the majority of its sales, was ahead of expectations, according to Barclays analysts.\n\n\"The good news is when you have more muted pricing, more consumers buy more of your brands,\" Pitkethly said, adding that minimal commodity price inflation had also inhibited the ability to raise prices.\n\nHe said the main pricing trouble spots were Brazil and Indonesia, which both saw prices fall due to weak consumer sentiment; India, due to a tax change put through last year; and Britain, where retail competition is fierce.\n\nThese four countries make up 25% of Unilever's sales, Pitkethly said. Other countries, such as Turkey and Mexico, saw a good balance, he said.\n\nThe overall balance of price and volume would improve in the second half of the year, Pitkethly said.\n\nBoth companies confirmed their sales guidance for the year, with Nestle aiming for 2%-4% underlying sales growth and Unilever looking for 3%-5% growth. Unilever said growth in the second quarter would be near the lower end of the range.\n\nNestle also said it was on track to return to mid-single-digit underlying sales growth by 2020.\n\nNestle highlighted a return to volume growth in the Americas, helped by strong petcare and coffee creamers sales, while growth in Asia benefited from the timing of the Chinese New Year.\n\nUnilever also called out a strong start in North America, helped by innovations such as the new brand Love Beauty and Planet and acquisitions such as Dollar Shave Club.\n\n(US$1 = 0.9687 Swiss francs)\n\n(US$1 = 0.8075 euros)", "date": "04-19-2018", "url": "http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/nestle-unilever-forgo-price-increases-move-product", "authors": [], "summary": "Nestle's 2.8% underlying sales growth only got a 0.2% boost from higher prices, and Unilever's 3.4% growth just a 0.1% lift.\n\"We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market's fears of weak pricing power, fuelled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities (prices),\" Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said.\nAs a result, sales volume in emerging markets, where Unilever does the majority of its sales, was ahead of expectations, according to Barclays analysts.\nBoth companies confirmed their sales guidance for the year, with Nestle aiming for 2%-4% underlying sales growth and Unilever looking for 3%-5% growth.\nNestle also said it was on track to return to mid-single-digit underlying sales growth by 2020.", "news": "The Edge Markets MY"}, {"title": "Lead Story: Market shock wave may see analyst downgrades", "keyword": ["fbm", "research", "lead", "analyst", "points", "market", "wave", "reforms", "shock", "growth", "downgrades", "target", "sentiment", "yearend", "earnings"], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Lead-Story_theedgemarkets_28.jpg?null", "text": "THE FBM KLCI has been on a rough ride over the past week as the government\u2019s onion-peeling approach to announcing its policy changes and reforms spooked investors while market sentiment turned even more fragile.\n\nLast Monday, the government triggered another shock wave when it said it had decided to scrap the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail. Two days later, it announced the cancellation of the Mass Rapid Transit 3 project.\n\nThe benchmark FBM KLCI saw its worse single-day fall since 2008 last Wednesday, plunging 3.52% to a month-and-a-half low of 1,719.28, before recovering some of its losses on Friday to close at 1,756.38 points.\n\nThe week before, the local bourse had also succumbed to a heavy selldown after the government revealed that the country\u2019s liabilities had breached RM1 trillion.\n\nThe exit of foreign investors from emerging market equities during the week ended May 25, amid external factors such as the trade dispute between the US and China as well as the US-North Korea summit being called off, also contributed to the decline.\n\nDisappointing corporate earnings for the first quarter of the year, as well as anticipation of further announcements by the government, exacerbated the generally uncertain environment, causing several research houses to mull revising their views on the local market and year-end FBM KLCI targets.\n\nNomura Holdings Inc downgraded Malaysian equities to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight\u201d, citing near-term uncertainties and negative news flow on the removal of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the reintroduction of fuel subsidies, which could pose a drag on Malaysia\u2019s financials, and economic and earnings growth rates.\n\nThe research house says a drag in investment growth rates could impact credit growth and, subsequently, earnings for the index, highlighting that 40% of the FBM KLCI\u2019s earnings come from Malaysian banks. It adds that there is a potential risk of deteriorating business sentiment amid the policy uncertainty.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are reluctant to be underweight as we hope the new government will come out with policies which address the fiscal concerns as well as embark on reforms which potentially could improve investor sentiment in the medium term.\u201d\n\nBased on previous experience, Nomura adds that the push for reforms, or even the \u201chope\u201d of reforms, can be powerful catalysts for stock market rallies, noting the case of India and Indonesia in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe research house says it would like to see reforms in government procurement, reduction in corruption and crony capitalism and the potential rolling back of government involvement in certain areas to promote a level playing field with the private sector.\n\nUOB Kay Hian, meanwhile, says it is looking to revise downwards its year-end target from its existing forecast of 1,830 amid the \u201csombre\u201d first-quarter earnings season.\n\n\u201cThere is downside to our 2018 target of 1,830 (based on 15.7 times 2019 PER) given that the 1Q2018 reporting season has disappointed, particularly in the telecom industry,\u201d says UOB Kay Hian head of equity research Vincent Khoo.\n\nHe adds that the government\u2019s decision on toll payments is keeping investors on edge, amid fears over government debt and the ramifications from the scrapping of mega projects.\n\nHowever, Khoo says the selldown of major construction companies with tolled expressways such as IJM Corp Bhd and Gamuda Bhd is overdone, as investors priced in the possibility of the government undercompensating the concessionaires.\n\n\u201cWe expect the government to undertake a more pragmatic solution that would be acceptable to the capital market, being fully aware that short-changing the toll concessionaires would broaden investor concerns well beyond the construction sector,\u201d he adds.\n\nMIDF Research head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman also indicates that the research house may review its year-end forecast for the FBM KLCI after reviewing corporate earnings for the first quarter.\n\n\u201cWe might review it and there might potentially be a downgrade from our year-end target of 1,900 points, pending our assessment of the latest corporate earnings. While the banks look good, our concerns lie in the major constituents like Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, plantation and property counters,\u201d he tells The Edge.\n\nBut not all are that pessimistic.\n\nAmBank Research says the disappointing first-quarter performance did not jeopardise the growth trajectory of the FBM KLCI\u2019s earnings and forecasts growth of 6.3% and 7.1% for 2018 and 2019 respectively, on the back of expected gross domestic product growth of 5.5% and 5.3% respectively.\n\n\u201cWe have year-end targets of 1,900 points and 2,040 points in 2018 and 2019 respectively for the FBM KLCI, based on 18.5 times 2018 and 2019 earnings respectively,\u201d AmBank Research analyst Joshua Ng writes in a note.\n\nHe says the FBM KLCI will be driven by a cyclical upturn in corporate earnings growth and the introduction of high PER stocks in the recent round of changes to the FBM KLCI component stocks, namely Press Metal Holdings Bhd, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dialog Group Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd.\n\nHe adds that greater clarity in the new government\u2019s policies, along with potential improvement in sentiment on emerging markets and a more level playing field across sectors, are key catalysts for the benchmark index.\n\nMeanwhile, downside risks include stronger-than-expected US inflation and wage growth, which increases the probability of a steeper rate hike in the US and a stronger greenback, an escalation in geopolitical tensions and earnings disappointments from FBM KLCI heavyweights like banks, telcos and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.\n\nInter-Pacific Securities head of research Pong Teng Siew also maintains his year-end target of 1,890 points despite the recent developments, although he reiterates that the index is unlikely to touch a new high this year.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the FBM KLCI takes a while to climb but when sentiment is down, it drops fast, like how we have seen the pullback in recent weeks. It took less than two months for the index to climb to its all-time high in April, so it will like take two or three times the duration for the FBM KLCI to recover to previous levels,\u201d he tells The Edge.", "date": "06-10-2018", "url": "http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-market-shock-wave-may-see-analyst-downgrades", "authors": [], "summary": "THE FBM KLCI has been on a rough ride over the past week as the government\u2019s onion-peeling approach to announcing its policy changes and reforms spooked investors while market sentiment turned even more fragile.\nLast Monday, the government triggered another shock wave when it said it had decided to scrap the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail.\nThe week before, the local bourse had also succumbed to a heavy selldown after the government revealed that the country\u2019s liabilities had breached RM1 trillion.\nUOB Kay Hian, meanwhile, says it is looking to revise downwards its year-end target from its existing forecast of 1,830 amid the \u201csombre\u201d first-quarter earnings season.\n\u201cWe might review it and there might potentially be a downgrade from our year-end target of 1,900 points, pending our assessment of the latest corporate earnings.", "news": "The Edge Markets MY"}, {"title": "Ringgit boost for investors, importers - Business News", "keyword": ["importers", "research", "local", "strong", "level", "companies", "investors", "boost", "gains", "food", "stocks", "sales", "business", "consumer"], "top-image": "http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2018/01/05/18/54/bizw_p3d_0601_jy_1.ashx/?w=620&h=413&crop=1&hash=5ABAD0DC12353884F9103275C5C49FD754E6E44A", "text": "THE New Year is in, tides are changing and the ringgit is recovering from the past two year\u2019s extreme blues.\n\n\n\nThe long-awaited reprieve has finally come for certain consumer companies that import intermediary goods for their production cycle.\n\n\n\nForeigners who have taken advantage by accumulating and buying into the equity and/or bond market when the ringgit was at a weaker level last year, would be firmly in the money now.\n\n\n\nAnalysts see the local currency as now being on a cruise control climb mode moving to new highs in the past week and possibly in the near future.\n\n\n\nThey note that the foreign buyers would see two-way gains and would be able to realise their gains if they choose to.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they liquidate and take the money out they will realise the gains and benefit. Last year the ringgit strengthened by almost 10.4%. Ringgit already broke the crucial 4.00 level, assuming that they make money from the market and take it out, they will also pay less to convert to US dollar,\u201d Socio Economic Research Centre\u2019s executive director Lee Heng Guie tells StarBizWeek.\n\n\n\nThe ringgit had seen a gain of 0.64% after we entered the New Year, adding to its gains that was achieved in the past two months of 5.63%.\n\n\n\nCurrency strategists agree that the next crucial psychological mark would be the 3.80 level that is the infamous currency peg level some years after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.\n\n\n\nThe recovering oil prices with the lifting of equity markets due to strong global sentiment aided gains in the ringgit, Lee says.\n\n\n\nThe FBM KLCI saw a strong upward move as investors celebrated Christmas and ushered in the New Year thereafter.\n\n\n\nThe benchmark index had gained some 4.6% since Dec 19 to yesterday\u2019s close at 1,817.97.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the other companies that will stand to gain are consumer-driven companies especially those that have imported intermediary goods to manufacture or complete end products.\n\n\n\nLee says the strengthening ringgit, if it is sustained, would eventually help to boost the consumer sentiment index (CSI).\n\nStrong gains: The Dutch Lady Milk Industries factory in Petaling Jaya. The company\u2019s stocks had been making strong gains since last year.\n\nIn the latest reported third quarter of 2017, the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (Mier) said the CSI continued to remain weak with the index having retreated further to 77.1.\u201cAnxieties over higher prices grow and (there are) burly spending plans amid waning incomes and jobs,\u201d the Mier said at the release of third quarter CSI figures then.Any CSI level below the 100 indicates weakness on the consumer front.Lee says he is hopeful the stronger ringgit would help eventually translate to additional cost savings to the consumer in the form of lower prices.Meanwhile, MIDF Research\u2019s consumer stocks analyst Nabil Fithri says not all consumer companies would automatically gain from the strengthening ringgit.He notes that the gainers among the consumer companies would mainly be those which derive their sales from the local market and have imported intermediary goods in the supply chain.\u201cOn average, the companies that import their raw materials lock in the prices through forward contracts for the upcoming six months. So, if there are any gains to their profit margins, it would be seen in the second half of the year,\u201d he says.Among the companies that stand to gain from this trend are the major consumer food companies such as Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (F&N), Nestle (M) Bhd and Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd All three stocks have been making strong gains in their share prices last year despite their high base.Observers note that a common theme today that belies these stocks are that they derive their sales from the local market, with minimal or zero exports.
