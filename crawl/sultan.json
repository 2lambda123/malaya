(special) Conference of Rulers held at Istana Negara in Kuala Lumpur today.\n\nIn a statement in Kuala Lumpur, the Keeper of the Rulers\u2019 Seal, Syed Danial Syed Ahmad, said the appointment would take effect on Dec 13, for a period of five years.\n\nThe Sultan of Perak, Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah, was chosen as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong for the same period.\n\nThe special conference attended by all the Malay rulers was chaired by the Raja of Perlis, Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Jamalullail.\n\nSultan Muhammad V is a King of the people and very close to the hearts of the people in the state.\n\nThe eldest son of Sultan Ismail Petra who was previously known as Tengku Muhammad Faris Petra, 47, used the name Sultan Muhammad V after being proclaimed the 29th Sultan of Kelantan on Sept 13, 2010.\n\nSultan Muhammad V, who often refers to himself as \u2018kita\u2019 when meeting with the people of this state loves going down to the ground, including the interior areas and Orang Asli settlements in Gua Musang and Jeli.\n\nSultan Muhammad V who was installed as the Tengku Mahkota of Kelantan on Oct 6, 1985, prefers to wear a \u2018jubah\u2019 (robe) or \u2018baju Melayu\u2019 (Malay attire) which is known in the state as \u2018baju gumbang\u2019 with a \u2018kain pelikat\u2019 (sarong cloth) and a white \u2018kopiah\u2019 (skullcap) when making visits on his subjects.\n\nSultan Muhammad V, who was previously the Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong since Dec 12, 2011, had sparked the idea for the Walkathon D\u2019Raja Kelantan programme since 2011 which is aimed at strengthening relationship with the people.\n\nThrough the Walkathon D\u2019Raja Kelantan programme, thousands of people from all walks of life in Kelantan have the opportunity to walk with Sultan Muhammad V and the Kelantan royal family for 10km around the city of Kota Baru.\n\nAlong the walkathon route, there are also several checkpoints that showcase a variety of cultural performances such as \u2018dikir barat\u2019, \u2018kertuk\u2019 and \u2018rebana ubi\u2019 (traditional musical instruments).\n\nIn 2011, the programme managed to enter into the Malaysia Book Of Records when it drew about 21,000 participants.\n\nThe charity programme organised by the Pertubuhan Kerabat D\u2019Raja Kelantan Al-Muhammadi is aimed at fostering closer ties between Sultan Muhammad V and the people, promoting a healthy lifestyle and becoming a tourist attraction in the state.\n\nNurturing spiritual values\n\nHe has also nurtured spiritual values among the Muslim community in the state through the organising of Qiam With Me programme, which is held every year since 2011 and during the month of Ramadan.\n\nThe programme which starts at around 10pm after the Isyak and Terawih prayers, will be followed by a religious lecture from a guest preacher, Qiamullail (Qiam means standing to denote prayer), before performing the Subuh prayers in congregation.\n\nAt the programme, Sultan Muhammad V will also present zakat donations to the asnaf (qualified group) recipients and the less fortunate.\n\nBoth programmes - Walkathon D\u2019Raja Kelantan and Qiam With Me - are included in the state\u2019s tourism calendar and serve as another unique tourist attraction in the state.\n\nDespite his popularity as the Sultan of Kelantan who often received wide coverage from media practitioners in the state, he always demonstrates sincere concern for the welfare of villagers and extends assistance to those in need without making a fuss about it for the media.\n\nIn fact, a picture of Sultan Muhammad V driving a four-wheel drive vehicle alone after Kelantan was hit by massive floods in 2014 had spread in social media.\n\nBorn on Oct 6, 1969, Sultan Muhammad V received his early education at Sekolah Sultan Ismail I here before continuing his studies at the Alice Smith International School in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHe was then enrolled in the Oakham School Rutland, England until 1989 before pursuing diplomatic studies at the St Cross College, Oxford and the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies until 1991.\n\nSultan Muhammad V, who is Universiti Malaysia Kelantan (UMK) chancellor, fills his free time by reading and has an interest in extreme sports such as four-wheel drive expeditions and endurance challenges and shooting.\n\nHe has three younger siblings who are the Tengku Mahkota of Kelantan Tengku Dr Muhammad Faiz Petra, 42, Tengku Muhammad Fakhry Petra, 38, and Tengku Amalin A\u2019ishah Putri, 32.\n\n- Bernama"}, {"url":

We take pride in being Bangsa Johor and I want to know where the owner of this launderette learnt his Islam?\n\n\u201cIslam teaches the faithful to be tolerant and respect other people and faiths,\u201d Sultan Ibrahim said, according to The Star.\n\nThe Johor ruler also criticised the laundrette owner over the implications of having a \u201cMuslims-only\u201d policy for his business.\n\n\u201cIs he saying only the clothes of Muslims are clean and those of non-Muslims are unclean?

This is too extreme. I\u2019m appalled.\u201d\n\nIn two subsequent posts, Tunku Idris uploaded an image with the text: \u201cThe Quran says, \u2018speak good to people\u2019 and that it doesn\u2019t say to \u2018speak good only to Muslims\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe second image was of a Quranic verse which states: \u201cFor you is your religion, and for me is my religion\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Sultan Ibrahim said that he was \u201cdeeply appalled\u201d by the laundrette owner\u2019s actions, adding that if such matters were not stopped, it would lead to more narrow-minded actions in the name of Islam.\n\n\u201cI could not keep quiet on the issue, as if this was allowed to go unnoticed, then next we will have taxis for only Muslims or non-Muslims.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/09/12/late-kedah-sultan-remembered-for-humility-friendliness/", "keyword": ["yang", "late", "abdul", "passing", "ruler", "sultan", "humility", "remembered", "agong", "halim", "kedah", "person", "friendliness"], "summary": "Senior citizen describes experience watching late Sultan from afar and up-close not long ago, including how he would stop his car to talk to friends.\n\u201cI have seen the Kedah sultan stopping his car and getting his driver to call out to his classmates passing by.\nThannimalai, 81, who was awarded the Justice of Peace and the Dato Setia Diraja Kedah by the late sultan, said the ruler\u2019s memory was great.\nMeanwhile, Kedah DAP assemblyman Tan Kok Yew described the late sultan as one who personified integrity.\nSultan Abdul Halim was born on Nov 28, 1927, and ascended the Kedah throne after the demise of his father, Sultan Badlishah, in 1959.", "title": "Late Kedah sultan remembered for humility, friendliness", "top-image": "http://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sultan.jpg", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters", "Predeep Nambiar"], "date": "09-11-2017", "language": "eng", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "text": "Senior citizen describes experience watching late Sultan from afar and up-close not long ago, including how he would stop his car to talk to friends.\n\nGEORGE TOWN: Community leaders in Kedah expressed their grief over the passing of their beloved Sultan Abdul Halim Mu\u2019adzam Shah, calling the ruler the \u201crakyat\u2019s man\u201d, marking his passing as a great loss to the country and the rice-bowl state.\n\nV Thannimalai, who is the deputy president of the National Council of Senior Citizens\u2019 Organisations Malaysia, said the late sultan was a down-to-earth person and mingled with all and sundry.\n\n\u201cVery friendly person, we love him very much because of his simplicity, and he keeps in touch with his classmates.\n\n\u201cI have seen the Kedah sultan stopping his car and getting his driver to call out to his classmates passing by.
