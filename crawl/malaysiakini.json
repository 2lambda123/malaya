What did the party do when it became evident to the whole world that something very wrong had taken place?\n\nInternally the coalition in power - of which Umno was the dominant member - did all it could to disguise, camouflage, deny and obstruct any kind of investigation.\n\nWhen billions of dollars of our money was being squandered by one Jho Low, all departments of government including the Attorney-General's Chambers and the police, and of course 1MDB, said that it was not our money.\n\n1MDB claimed it had lost nothing. The superyacht Equanimity was not ours. Foreign governments like the US and Switzerland were astonished that we did not want the return of our confiscated money. They knew it was ours. We denied it was ours.\n\nAnd Ku Li, you say the party's standing is unaffected?\n\nSalam: Of course, Umno is tainted. The loot was hauled from the premises of the former Umno president, who still claims to this date that more than RM100 million in cash is either Umno funds or \"election funds\", and who has described details of Umno's \"money management culture\", which sounds more like a criminal gang rather than a registered society.\n\nThis is the long historical downward slide of what used to be a grassroots party, the bulk of whom were ordinary schoolteachers and simple workers, into a party of power, money and greed, and eventually consumed by the disease of corruption.\n\nThey are so thoroughly infected that they can't differentiate between right and wrong anymore. It's obvious that the party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, by new leaders unconnected to the previous government or to Umno's sordid past. But who is left?\n\nAnonymous 2436471476414726: Razaleigh, who are you kidding? Of course, it has everything to do with Umno.\n\nHe was your president, some of you even claimed he was god-sent. Surely, some of you knew what Najib Razak was up to, but none would squeal. In fact, some defended him stoutly.\n\nGiven such culture in Umno, Najib was happily amassing his personal wealth by allegedly robbing the nation's coffer like nobody's business. Bet you he is not the only Umno leader who made a fortune out of his position in the party or government.\n\nSo Ku Li, we don't buy your story that the seizure of Najib's loot has nothing to do with Umno. As they say, when a fish rots, it rots from the head. The head is surely rotten in this case, so is the whole body.\n\nSimple Malaysian: Indeed, many of the current Umno leaders not only stood by Najib but also swore to his innocence when the news of the scandal broke out.\n\nKu Li, notwithstanding your comments that Umno should apologise for its past mistakes, these Umno leaders are expected to be retained after the coming party elections and they are still linked in some way to the alleged \"crime\" by Najib.\n\nTo say Umno's standing is unaffected is an understatement, if I may say so.\n\nAnonymous_1371475682: Are you kidding me, Ku Li? You and your party supported 'Bonnie and Clyde'.\n\nMost likely, there are more cronies in your party than we can ever imagine (maybe you are just blind). Corruption has seeped down to the core, from the top leaders to the bottom. And some Umno leaders still have no shame and came out to claim the seized money belongs to Umno.\n\nI see you as one double-headed snake that follows where the wind blows. You have never been constructive in criticising wrongdoing when you were required to.\n\nNo one can change overnight, and definitely not anyone of you in your party. Go retire.\n\nPlease Trust Me: Ku Li, you are 81 years old and you have forgotten the Umno declaration on May 24, just over a month ago, that the money seized belongs to Umno and had asked for it to be returned to Umno.\n\nA smart leader would admit the wrongdoings and will convince the people about his future plans. Do you think Dr Mahathir Mohamad would have been accepted as the new PM if he didn't admit his past mistakes?\n\nHumans are very forgiving in nature, and we only want to move on. We trust people are allowed to make mistakes if they are prepared to correct them.\n\nThe people that you want to serve want to see how you deal with your party's mistakes and how you answer to them. Don't forget that you need their support, and your sincerity will be felt and seen by all.\n\nYou are adopting the culture of Umno - denying, blaming, rationalising are all your defence mechanisms to protect the ugly side of you. Don't treat people as na\u00efve. Instead, work together with them and understand their needs. Forget about personal greed.\n\nAnonymous 2478181499087834: Ku Li, this is the same old tired song you all have been singing since the 50s. Like the three monkeys - hear nothing, see nothing, say nothing. But now you have the mother of all monkeys - deny, ignore, cover up.\n\nDon't you realise this stance is what brought Umno and Najib down? The whole world is shell-shocked with all the looted treasures paraded publicly by our very own police. Yet you are all claiming to want to reform and transform your Umno, and you want to be the party president.\n\nFormer Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin said the same thing. Acting president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Najib's noisy kompang, is maintaining his elegant silence. So what has changed? Why are you all still standing for president?\n\nOh, I remember why: you said Umno has immense valuable assets all over the country. I would suggest Umno members elect the other two unknowns as president and deputy president. There may be some hope then.\n\nAnonymous#007: Ku Li, like other Umno members, are trying very hard to distance themselves and Umno from Najib, kleptocracy and corruption they had encouraged and supported - directly or indirectly - in the last 60 years.\n\nThey are using the social media to rebrand themselves - the train of statements in the last few weeks reeks of the help of expensive image professionals. But, the rakyat will forever link Umno to Najib and his gang in the alleged thieving of hundreds of billions from the poor rakyat.\n\nGiven the mountain of credible evidence of grand corruption involving Umno members, there should be a detailed probe on Umno assets as well.\n\nFinally, let us not forget Umno is essentially an illegal entity if the rule of law were applied judiciously and professionally.\n\nFalcon: Denial of reality and politically delusional statements seem to be the twin pillars of Umno, and nothing seems to have changed for the better.\n\nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.

That is why there are courts to examine the evidence and determine the truth.\n\nWhen the courts declare that Najib did not steal, then he will be vindicated though I very much doubt it in the light at the amount of gold, jewels, money and handbags worth millions found in his properties.\n\nOn his salary, there is no way he can earn a fraction of what has been discovered. So, the courts will determine whether he is a thief.\n\nCogito Ergo Sum: You can fool some of the people all the time. Obviously, you have been fooling the people of Pekan for 41 years with \u2018dedak\u2019 (animal feed) and blocking important information from reaching them.\n\nBut all this will end when evidence of your alleged greed will be exposed and dissected by the prosecution.\n\nAnd I am sure your lawyers will try to keep postponing the matter for as long as possible. But the matter is urgent and a certificate of urgency must be filed by the prosecution.\n\nIt is of great public interest to see how their monies have been frittered away by an alleged kleptomaniac. It will be interesting to see how you answer and rebut the questions put to you by the prosecutors.\n\nSusahkes: Dear ex-PM, you once said that you treasure loyalty above brains, but I got to admit, I didn't realise you also apply that yardstick to your own self.\n\nYou should tape yourself and listen to your own conversation if only to know how ridiculous you sound.\n\nFor the life of me, I cannot fathom how you managed to stay on as PM since 2009, for there is no explanation for the levels of ridiculousness that you have lowered yourself to.\n\nPrudent: PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad is very likely giving MO1 (Malaysian Official 1) enough rope to hang himself.\n\nEvery time he opens his mouth, he incriminates himself a lot more and loses even more sympathy among Malaysians.\n\nMalaysians' attitude towards MO1 is being hardened by his total lack of remorse and claims of innocence - all make against the growing weight of evidence.\n\nApa Nama: Yes, Najib, you did not steal money from the people but you steal trust from the people.\n\nYou are still in denial. I am not saying you are wrong. That is for the court to prove. You are innocent until proven guilty as far as the law is concerned.\n\nBy saying, \"I did not steal from people\" did not free you from any wrongdoings during your tenure as PM. The abuse of the office of PM during your tenure is well documented.\n\nIt will be revealed in due course.\n\nDrngsc: Indeed, you are in severe denial. Soon, we will all know the details of how you allegedly stole, and stole so much.\n\n1MDB was never an investment company. We now know the details. 1MDB was a company set up to allegedly steal from Malaysians.\n\nThere was no real attempt to invest. From the very beginning, it was to borrow and transfer money to yourself and your cronies. In large scale.\n\nJust move the money all over the world through fraudulent companies, in offshore accounts usually used by money launderers, and then used it for all kinds of private schemes to buy properties, jewellery, make films, buy yacht, have champagne parties, and when money ran out, sell Malaysian assets to cover your debts.\n\nThat is not investment. That is robbery.\n\nGerard Lourdesamy: Even in defeat, he still wants to lie. So the DOJ is lying? The Swiss, Luxembourg and Singapore governments are lying?

constitutionality of the recently passed Anti-Fake News Act 2018.\n\nThe portal is the first to file the challenge against the controversial law which had been highly criticised by federal lawmakers and also human rights groups.\n\nMalaysiakini through its company Mkini Dotcom Sdn Bhd named the Home Ministry and the Malaysian government as respondents in the case filed at the Kuala Lumpur High Court.\n\nThe application was filed by the law firm of Daim and Gamany.\n\nThe portal is seeking leave for a declaration that the Anti-Fake News Act 2018 is in violation of Article 5, and Article 10 (1), read together with Article 8 and therefore unconstitutional, and should be declared null and void.\n\nArticle 5 concerns the liberty of a person while Article 10(1) concerns freedom of speech.\n\nIt is also seeking a mandamus to compel the court to direct the Home Ministry to revoke the gazetted law dated April 11 this year which makes the bill to become a law.\n\nMalaysiakini is also seeking any other relief deemed fit by the court.\n\nMkini Dotcom's chief executive officer and director, Premesh Chandran, in his supporting affidavit to the application, said the portal has been in operation since Nov 20, 1999, and since then, also operates KiniTV.com as part of the Mkini Group.\n\nPremesh said the law penalises anyone that maliciously creates, offers, publishes, prints, distributes, circulates or disseminates fake news.\n\nFake news under the Act is defined as \"any news, information, data and reports which is or partly false, whether in the form of features, visuals, or audio recordings or in any form of capable of suggesting words or ideas.\"\n\nPremesh claimed the portal produces articles by way of reportage and hence the impact of the new legislation is to remove the defence of reportage that is available to the portal.\n\nHe further alleged that the Act places an insurmountable burden on the portal to ensure each and every article published by

Arul was brought in for the rationalisation plan, i.e. use assets to cover up the alleged plundering and also resolve the debt issue.\n\n1MDB likes to claim that its assets are more than its debts. What is not stated is that these debts were not accumulated in the process of acquiring the assets, which were mostly given free or cheaply by the government.\n\nSo, why were these debts incurred? 1MDB is yet to produce its annual reports for the last several years. It claims the police seized its documents for investigation and therefore it can't complete the audit reports.\n\nThe police will take forever to complete its so-called investigation into the 1MDB scandal. How is the company operating without producing annual reports? It appears that the company and the police are in cahoots to cover up a massive crime against the people. I stand corrected.\n\nArul has also been quoted several times as saying that 1MDB didn\u2019t lose any money. If so, why didn\u2019t he go to California and tell that to the court there?\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) case is a civil action to freeze, seize and forfeit assets acquired illegally from funds originating from 1MDB.\n\nThe DOJ estimates that US$4.5 billion was plundered from 1MDB. There would be a criminal case if the civil action is challenged by those from whom the assets were seized.\n\nThe international law on money laundering, which is in force since 911 (September 11), defines money laundering as having assets far in excess of what can be legitimately accumulated over a lifetime.\n\nThat\u2019s how Jho Low and Riza Aziz got caught. That\u2019s why Equanimity, the US$250 million superyacht, was seized in Indonesia.\n\nGerard Lourdesamy: Arul, your version does not hold water when compared to the DOJ court filings, whatever their motives or purposes.\n\nThe fact is billions of dollars of 1MDB money was allegedly misappropriated through fraud and cheating.\n\nIf the government wants to restore some credibility, just de-classify the Auditor-General's Report on 1MBD, including the Bank Negara letters to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), and convene a royal commission of inquiry consisting of eminent retired judges of impeccable repute, independence and integrity from Malaysia and the Commonwealth such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa to investigate 1MDB and all the key players involved.\n\nUntil then, Arul, you can read from the script like a bad actor but the rakyat in GE14 will ensure that the BN and its director, Najib Razak, will go bust.\n\nQuigonbond: The fact that Malaysian Official 1 (MO1) refuses to sue Wall Street Journal for defamation in the US is proof enough that there is cover-up in Malaysia.\n\nA goliath like US has little interest to interfere with Malaysian politics.\n\nIpohcrite: I can only say Arul is just too smooth \u2013 he responded to a simple question with a beating-about-the-bush answer that convinces nobody but the diehard believers in Umno.\n\nHe has perfected the art of answering his own FAQs (frequently-asked questions) as well as questions thrown at him by Malaysiakini.\n\nPretzel Dog: So Arul, can we take it that you're prepared to accept these 'fund units' as your salary?\n\nArul Kanda: 1MDB roadshow prompted DAP to roll out 'big bazooka'\n\nCQ MUARku: There is no deal big with regard to Arul's recent roadshow explaining and justifying the state and \"facts\" of 1MDB to a gullible audience.\n\nHis \"talks\" were mainly amongst Umno branches, and behind closed doors. To cite an example, the one held in Muar was at the Muar Umno branch\u2019s Ninam Shah hall.\n\nThose who attended were confined to friends and members of Umno. Those who attended were awed by his \"eloquence and authority\" enhanced by charts and figures. Very impressive, but you bet, full of salesman talk.\n\nIt\u2019s a one-sided exposition by a highly paid professional and slave of the MO1. That's all there is to it.\n\nMalaysian-United: Indeed, Arul has shared practically nothing about 1MDB.\n\nWhatever \"information\" he has \"shared\" so far never goes to reveal anything about the funds that went missing, rather they were carefully structured responses to questions by interested parties to conceal the form and whereabouts of the said funds.\n\nAll he did was beat around the bush and contort whatever limited \"facts\" he was prepared to provide when asked rather simple and straightforward questions by interested parties.\n\nYou do not need a trained accountant or a financial whiz to do his job; any ordinary con-man from the streets will do.\n\nSo how will his \"roadshows\" enlighten the people on the 1MDB scandal apart from the sweet nothings he has told us in the past?\n\nHe can keep repeating \"fund units\" from dawn to dusk and until he goes hoarse but he will never be able to show us the money.\n\nAnonymous 2475871497500343: Why don\u2019t you debate with your \"best friend\" (DAP MP Tony Pua) on 1MDB scandal?\n\nArul, please don't waste your time go around the country explaining your company's perspective, the story of the events and facts, you have failed your duty as the CEO of 1MDB because you can't even produce the audited financial statements of 1MDB for the past four years and the last financial statement prepared by Deloitte was for the period ending March 2014.\n\nThere is no excuse for passing the buck to the police for not returning your company documents. The only way to have a proper investigation of 1MDB is to have royal commission of inquiry, which will never be possible under Umno's rule.\n\nPakcik Am: Arul must know that 1MDB was short of funds in the amount of RM17,700,000,000. That money had allegedly disappeared.\n\nHis job was to neutralise that and to camouflage it. That makes him an accessory after the fact.\n\nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers. Only paying subscribers can post comments.

There will be a slight impact but not what some people term as a Malay tsunami\u2026 that will not happen,\u201d Negeri Sembilan Menteri Besar Mohamad Hasan said in a special interview with Bernama.\n\nIf there is no impact or only slight impact, why is he so bothered by it that he made this a main topic for discussion?\n\nCogito Ergo Sum: It won\u2019t be a tsunami. Treated like a rogue by Umno/BN, former premier Dr Mahathir Mohamad will be like a rogue wave who will wash away all the old sand bars and barriers, and stem the tide of corruption, bigotry and divisive politics.\n\nThe old pirate ships will be tossed aside in the wake of this wave, which sometimes can reach up to 10 storeys in height. That\u2019s when the rats will start jumping ship as tables are overturned.\n\nAnonymous #19098644: Wherever Mahathir goes, he's treated like a film star, with people rushing to shake his hands, take selfies, and everybody stands up voluntarily to show their respect for him in spite of him holding no official positions.\n\nOnly the \"raja lawaks\" (comedy kings), \"kaki bodek\" (apple polishers) and Umno \"barua\" (lackeys) still refuse to acknowledge reality, just like when the world is condemning 1MDB, our cabinet ministers still pretend that is it fake news.\n\nMukhriz: Dr M foresaw the start of Umno's rot\n\nHplooi: To a certain extent, Bersatu deputy president Mukhriz Mahathir is right. The right-wing faction (previously \"ultras\" who became \"mainstream\" post-1969) set about implementing their agenda with four key thrusts.\n\n1. Fine tune the electoral system to ensure dominance. The first targets were urban centres that were prime anti-Umno centres. Kuala Lumpur was carved out of Selangor, thereby neutering the city that played a key role in the 1969 election. Since then, the Election Commission has been brought completely under control.\n\nThere were attempts at urban re-engineering, which included creating Malay urban areas in Kuala Lumpur (from the 70s to the 80s).\n\n2. Asserting total dominance on the executive led to Malay \"nationalism\". The executive, which used to be multiracial, became monoracial.\n\n3. Make education more favourable to the masses. This included top down (Mara, scholarships, easier university entry, etc) and bottom up (destroy the dominant liberal English stream and replace it with Malay stream).\n\n4. State intervention in the economy \u2013 for example, former premier Abdul Razak Hussein's request to tycoon Robert Kuok to acquire shares in Malaysia International Shipping Corporation (MISC). Transportation and banking were the first wave.\n\nBut the framework underpinning the above said was therefore set:\n\n1. The warlord system.\n\n2. Patronage and rent-seeking, for example, former finance minister Daim Zainuddin (a precocious student by one account) went on to become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rent-seeking economy.\n\n3. Exclusivity and race identification became a badge of political leverage. When Mahathir took over as prime minister, the system had already been set and he maxed out the system to his advantage.\n\nBut Dr M was also a \"visionary,\" in that:\n\n1. He sought to liberalise the system (which was seen by the non-Muslims to be a breath of fresh air, after the oppressive 70s and 80s.\n\n2. He tackled red tape and bureaucratic corruption. Although the Malaysian bureaucracy was corrupt, this was the norm in most of Asia, and Malaysia was then relatively less so. Some of the most 'creatively corrupt' civil servants I have dealt with in the 1980s were Chinese (which illustrates the fact that it is the system, not the race).\n\n3. He had a vision for industrialisation using the Japanese Zaibatsu model.\n\nThe above framework eventually became contradictions.\n\nThe failures of Dr M can be listed as:\n\n1. Despite his vision, he was a poor judge of character. People he picked were incompetent or corrupt. And this cuts across race. Remember Abdullah Ang?\n\n2. The contradictions within the system (warlordism, Malay nationalism becoming more extreme, etc.) became too big for his vision. In time, Umno politicians with any pretensions to importance deemed it their birth right to the gravy train (Cowgate, or the National Feedlot Corporation scandal, is just the tip of the iceberg).\n\n3. The vision of industrialisation by appointing captains of industry (the Japan Zaibatsu model) was a failure. While Japan's captains performed their national task with competence and patriotic fervour, the same could not be said of our 'Malaysian captains'.\n\n4. The warlord and patronage system engendered a system where national resources were commandeered at the behest of Umno. By Daim's time, even Umno interests had become blurred with personal interest.\n\n5. Brainwashing and the empowering the religious right was the direct result of race politics.\n\nExistential Turd: Scandals such as 1MDB today can be traced all the way to Malay protectionism. From there, came Malay privileges and supremacy. Then came Umno privileges and supremacy.\n\nThen when the pie was not big enough to sustain so many cronies, the circle of privileges shrank further to a select few in Umno.\n\nBersatu splintered from Umno because its members were not satisfied with the way the pie was being distributed. However, they did not oppose Umno based on principle. It was all about the \"dedak\".\n\nShovelnose: Is Mukhriz feeling remorseful after the deceit had been revealed? It's not too late to turn our eyes back to God and live righteously. Sack the thieves, the greedy and evil ones.\n\nTurn over a new leaf and return the land to the people.\n\nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.

But it couldn\u2019t have been accomplished without YOU. A big thank you to all those who have participated in the effort.\n\nSome of you have asked why we needed to reach out to Malaysians to raise the money. Here\u2019s why:\n\nMalaysiakini\u2019s annual budget is RM6.5 million. This goes towards funding the operation of four of the country\u2019s top news websites in English, Bahasa Malaysia and Chinese as well as KiniTV.\n\nIn addition, we serve 4.3 million Facebook fans and 1.3 million Twitter followers. Apart from journalists and editors, we have a team of advertising executives under our sister company FG Media, another team to handle technology and of course, the subscriptions and administrative department.\n\nOur aim for each financial year is simple \u2013 to make sure that we earn enough to cover our expenses. And we have been doing that over the past 18 years. Yes, there were good years and there were bad years. In good years, we reinvest much of our profit back into the company. In bad years, we tighten our belts.\n\nOur major income comes from advertising and subscriptions. However, as most online news portals have discovered, earning money from advertising is extremely tough.\n\nWhile online advertising has grown by leaps and bounds, those who benefit most from it are not content providers; they are the big technology companies like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft and Twitter, to name a few. Search engines alone control almost 50 percent of the market.\n\nWebsites such as Malaysiakini are competing not just with other local brands for advertising but with super companies, the likes of Google. Moreover, online advertising does not bring in the kind of top dollar that print or broadcast advertising once commanded.\n\nOld media may earn, say, about RM100 in advertisement revenue for every reader. News websites earn just RM1 per reader, per year. That\u2019s 100 times less than what the print media used to earn. So advertising alone cannot support a news website like Malaysiakini.\n\nOur saviour is our paywall. Income from subscriptions is more stable and predictable than advertising, which is tied to the health of the economy since companies spend more in good times. Without the income from subscriptions, Malaysiakini would have folded up a long time ago.\n\nAnd to maintain this hand-to-mouth existence, we have kept a tight rein on our expenses, in particular salaries, which is our biggest outlay. Many of those who work for Malaysiakini get lower than what the market pays.\n\nIndeed, those in senior management earn almost half of those in similar positions elsewhere. Clearly, everyone in Malaysiakini is making tremendous sacrifices to keep the operation going.\n\nWe are not complaining. It is a sacrifice we are willing to make. We embarked on this journey with our eyes wide open. We knew there would be little money to make. We knew there would be harassment, arrests and attacks.\n\nAnd it was difficult for us to hire good people with the salaries we offered. However, we believed that if we trained those who were a little wet behind their ears, they would one day be among the giants in the industry.\n\nOther legal battles\n\nSo, this is why we had to raise money from the public. We don\u2019t have a contingency for such unexpected off-budget items. Our legal battles are mostly fought by lawyers who represent us pro-bono.\n\nThe last time we went to the ground to raise funds was four years ago \u2013 the \u2018Buy a Brick\u2019 campaign which raised RM1.7 million for our new building in Petaling Jaya. We hope we don\u2019t have to do this very often.\n\nAnd yes, there are other legal battles \u2013 the National Feedlot Corporation (NFC) lawsuit which we won in the High Court and has now gone up to the Court of Appeal. There is also the lawsuit by Deputy Agro-Based Industries Minister Tajuddin Abdul Rahman over our reports on the fracas at Parliament grounds. That has yet to be heard in the High Court.\n\nAnd there is the big one \u2013 the lawsuit by Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak over comments by our readers. Again, this has yet to be heard by the High Court as our lawyers are filing constitutional challenges.\n\nOn top of that, both of us have to fight criminal charges over the KiniTV video which has upset attorney-general Mohamed Apandi Ali. That will soon be heard in the Cyber Court.\n\nWe are confident that we will prevail in these court battles. And we are confident, perhaps more so now, that you will stand by us again should the law fail us.\n\nMore than 2,175 supporters have contributed to the Defend Malaysiakini Fund in the past two weeks. Almost all are small amounts, the biggest being RM3,500. The Bukit Koman villagers also helped to chip in as well. And some of you even contributed more than once.\n\nThere were no tycoons, no corporate sponsorship. Only people like you \u2013 wage earners, the self-employed, retirees \u2013 giving their hard-earned money to the fund. It is this spirit which we promote among those who work in Malaysiakini. And it is this spirit that we want to see among our supporters and among all Malaysians.\n\nThe power of one, working alone, can achieve the extraordinary; but the power of many, working together, can achieve the impossible.\n\nFor that, we tip our hats to each and every one of you. Thank you!\n\nSTEVEN GAN and PREMESH CHANDRAN are co-founders of Malaysiakini and editor-in-chief and chief executive officer respectively.\n\nWhile Malaysiakini is officially ending the RM350,000 campaign, those who want to contribute can continue to do so, as any additional money will go into Malaysiakini's legal defence fund for future cases.\n\nThose wishing to contribute can bank in their donations to the following account:\n\nAccount name: Mkini Dotcom Sdn Bhd\n\nAccount no: 514253516714 (Maybank)\n\nSwift Code: MBBEMYKL\n\nBranch address: Dataran Maybank, Level 1 Tower A, Dataran Maybank, 59000 Kuala Lumpur.\n\nDonations can also be made through credit card by calling +603 7770 0017 or via PayPal.", "news": "Malaysiakini", "url": "https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/409777", "language": "eng", "summary": "Some of you have asked why we needed to reach out to Malaysians to raise the money.\nWithout the income from subscriptions, Malaysiakini would have folded up a long time ago.\nOther legal battlesSo, this is why we had to raise money from the public.\nThat has yet to be heard in the High Court.\nAgain, this has yet to be heard by the High Court as our lawyers are filing constitutional challenges.", "title": "Why does M\u2019kini need to raise money for legal defence?", "date": "01-23-2018", "top-image": "https://i.malaysiakini.com/1207/78262d21a6697f5abb6d3b5d0e0d7ab3.jpeg"}, {"keyword": ["rm500k", "mps", "govt", "policy", "receive", "previous", "rm100k", "allocation", "opposition", "prime", "mohamad", "pakatan", "providing", "wellhowever"], "authors": [], "text": "Departing from the previous BN administration's policy, the Pakatan Harapan government has announced it will be providing allocations to opposition MPs as well.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the allocation for opposition lawmakers would be less than what government MPs would receive...", "news": "Malaysiakini", "url": "https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/428533", "language": "eng", "summary": "Departing from the previous BN administration's policy, the Pakatan Harapan government has announced it will be providing allocations to opposition MPs as well.\nHowever, Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the allocation for opposition lawmakers would be less than what government MPs would receive...", "title": "Gov't MPs to get RM500k allocation, opposition MPs RM100k", "date": "06-06-2018", "top-image": "https://i.malaysiakini.com/1273/1f646d674d0616a78258d6fdd7d9c0a7.jpeg"}, {"keyword": ["doing", "mukhriz", "right", "didnt", "fact", "malaysia", "wouldnt", "better", "say", "umno", "mahathir", "youth", "know"], "authors": [], "text": "A+ A-\n\nCOMMENT | I refer to the Malaysiakini article titled Mukhriz: Dad threw a fit when Umno tried to field me in election.\n\nI find Mukhriz Mahathir's claim that his father, Dr Mahathir Mohamad threw a fit when Umno tried to field him as a candidate in the 1999 general election most amusing.\n\nFor starters, the late 1990s is now subject to some pretty extreme historical revisionism by Mahathir.\n\nSo I wouldn't put much stock in what he says he did or did not do in that period, since the versions change dramatically every so often.\n\nBut if we are on the subject of Mahathir throwing fits, the public should also be aware of the metaphorical one he had in more recent memory - when his son lost the bid to become one of the three Umno vice-presidents.\n\nMight it be coincidental that, at that moment too, Mahathir stepped up his attacks against Umno and the prime minister personally?\n\nIf one didn't know better, one might say that Mahathir took his son's loss as a personal affront by Najib Abdul Razak, whom he perceived to have helped the three incumbents retain their spot.\n\nIf one didn't know better, one might find this perception ironic, considering the iron grip Mahathir himself had on Umno in his decades as president - deciding who wins what seat where and when.\n\nThe master craftsman\n\nIf one didn't know better, one might assume that Mahathir was further affronted by the fact that one particular person, Khairy Jamaluddin, did in fact very publicly campaign for Hishammuddin Hussein to the clear electoral detriment of Mukhriz in that close contest for the third VP spot.\n\nIf one didn't know better, one might say that Mahathir never got over the fact that after so many years of trying to \u201cend\u201d Khairy, the guy just wouldn't go gently into the good night.\n\nBut instead, he had the nerve to try, and then succeed, in defeating Mukhriz in the 2009 contest for Umno Youth chief.\n\nIf one didn't know better, one might say this latest intervention about stopping his son contesting as a candidate in 1999 is vintage Mahathir, acting out the concerned, principled, elderly statesman routine that belies the master craftsman of a politician he actually is.\n\nHe who uses everything at his disposal and pulls every emotional string at the most opportune times to secure what he truly wants \u2013 an unassailable legacy, Lee Kuan Yew style.\n\nAlas, I guess we in BN ought to know better. Because surely Mahathir would not have the audacity to quit the party, rejoin and then quit again, form a new one, eat his own words, make countless bewildering U-turns on everything and culminate in signing off on a manifesto that essentially seeks to undo his own policies in office - for his own personal gain.\n\nSurely we ought to know better. This has nothing to do with his narrow agenda or vendetta. He's just not that type of person, right?

Sometimes there are even calls by people who I do not know, who hurl abuse when I am critical of the opposition. The funny thing is, I have more rational engagements with establishment supporters in terms of articles they write about my pieces than the apparatchiks who have hurled abuse, racist invective, built elaborate straw men and, yet, who pride themselves on being the people who want to \"save Malaysia.\"\n\nThis, of course, is nothing compared to what Malaysiakini columnist Maryam Lee has received. Young activists have sent me a data dump of toxic materials aimed at Maryam merely because she supports the #UndiRosak movement.\n\nFull disclosure. I wrote a two-part article critical of her arguments, hence I feel if none of her critics wants to address the toxic atmosphere she is facing, it may as well be me.\n\nTwo points that Maryam made when describing the toxic atmosphere she finds herself in are worth elaborating on.\n\n1. \u201cThis violence and abuse are coming from the very pact - Pakatan Harapan supporters - who call themselves different from Barisan Nasional.\u201d\n\nI have often wondered - and I am not alone in this as numerous foreign correspondents who read the local media wonder the same thing - how some folks who pride themselves on their progressive politics, who blame Umno/BN for the toxic politics of this country, have never had a problem hurling misogynist and racist abuse against people who are critical of the opposition or who disagree with their position.\n\nEven more troubling is that, most often, their intended targets have a history of social and political activism on behalf of the opposition.\n\nAs I wrote \u2013 \u201cI do not think civil society made tremendous progress. I think the opposition political elite made tremendous progress buttressed by civil society groups, who did not really understand the nature of the beast. There is this assumption that just because the politics of civil society groups and oppositional political parties aligned, there was some sort of understanding.

had defamed Raub Australian Gold Mining (RAGM) in a series of articles about the health risks associated with living near a mine.\n\nThe independent news site was ordered to pay 90,000 USD for damages and legal costs. The ruling was criticized by various human rights groups, who see the case as an attack on press freedom.\n\nAs part of an effort to appeal the decision before a higher court, Malaysiakini has successfully raise funds for its legal battle by asking for donations from its readers.\n\nMalaysiakini is one of the most widely read news sites in the country and has received awards for its coverage from the International Press Institute, Reporters without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists. The news site has been attacked in the past, with both legal and technical threats, particularly during times of political uncertainty.\n\nRAGM filed the defamation case after Malaysiakini published three news reports and two video clips on September 5, 2012 about the health concerns of residents in the central state of Pahang, where RAGM was operating a gold mine.\n\nIn 2016 Malaysia\u2019s High Court dismissed the case. But on January 12, 2018, the Court of Appeal reversed the ruling after reviewing the coverage of Malaysiakini. The ruling said that the news site was \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to get the side of the mining firm. During the initial trial, Malaysiakini said it merely covered a press conference by local groups about the destructive legacy of mining in their area.\n\nMalaysiakini has vowed to appeal the ruling. For its part, while RAGM maintains its position, the company has entered liquidation procedures after suffering financial losses. It is unclear whether this has created additional motivations for RAGM to pursue the case.\n\nThe ruling alarmed many groups, as it could set a precedent for large companies to pressure independent media who seek to cover their activities.\n\nBan Cyanide Action Committee was one of those which criticized the ruling:\n\nWe express our worries that the high sum of the claim by RAGM could drive media away from critically investigating and reporting issues of public interest that involved big corporations. This will further shrink the media freedom in the country.\n\nReporters Without Borders (RSF) insisted that the work of media should not be criminalized:\n\nIt is completely unacceptable and disproportionate that journalists should be the target of judicial proceedings just for attending a press conference serving the public interest.\n\nSome believe the ruling is politically-motivated. Sarawak Report suggested that it is intended to harass Malaysiakini and other independent media outlets:\n\nIt threatens to destroy Malaysia\u2019s most established, successful, best known and extensive independent online media operation just weeks before the prime minister launches his re-election bid in the midst of massive corruption scandals, involving billions of dollars of thefts of public money \u2013 by him personally.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s ruling party has been in power since the 1950s. Prime Minister Najib Razak has been accused of pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars through the anomalous transactions of a state-owned investment firm. Najib once sued Malaysiakini for allegedly allowing libelous comments to be posted on its website.\n\nWriting for Asia Sentinel, Mariam Mokhtar noted how the ruling can be considered as punishment and \u201cwarning to other newspapers to tread warily\u201d when reporting on issues that can affect the ruling party.\n\nSome think RAGM has powerful political connections that allowed it to appeal the case, despite the ruling of the High Court in 2016.\n\nAfter the announcement of the verdict on January 12, Malaysiakini immediately appealed for public donations to be used for its defense fund. About 2,175 supporters contributed to the defense fund in just 12 days.\n\nMalaysiakini CEO Premesh Chandran thanked all those who supported the company:\n\nIt was amazing that the sum was raised in just 12 days. It showed that the public supported our efforts to report community issues. On behalf of Malaysiakini's staff, I would like to thank all contributors and everyone who supported us in spirit.\n\nPremesh Chandran and Malaysiakini editor-in-chief Steven Gan vowed never to disappoint their contributors:\n\nThere were no tycoons, no corporate sponsorship. Only people like you \u2013 wage earners, the self-employed, retirees \u2013 giving their hard-earned money to the fund. It is this spirit which we promote among those who work in Malaysiakini. And it is this spirit that we want to see among our supporters and among all Malaysians.\n\nMalaysiakini said it will appeal its case before the Federal Court.", "news": "Global Voices Online", "url": "https://globalvoices.org/2018/02/01/malaysiakini-news-site-will-appeal-defamation-case-by-gold-mining-firm-thanks-to-crowdfunding-by-readers/", "language": "eng", "summary": "As part of an effort to appeal the decision before a higher court, Malaysiakini has successfully raise funds for its legal battle by asking for donations from its readers.\nBut on January 12, 2018, the Court of Appeal reversed the ruling after reviewing the coverage of Malaysiakini.\nThe ruling said that the news site was \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to get the side of the mining firm.\nAfter the announcement of the verdict on January 12, Malaysiakini immediately appealed for public donations to be used for its defense fund.\nMalaysiakini said it will appeal its case before the Federal Court.", "title": "Malaysiakini News Site Will Appeal Defamation Case by Gold Mining Firm, Thanks to Crowdfunding by Readers \u00b7 Global Voices", "date": "02-01-2018", "top-image": "https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/90572419_1aa4d37fbc_b-800x450.jpg"}, {"keyword": ["father", "happen", "think", "najibs", "daughter", "asks", "worried", "thought", "transactions", "najib", "urged", "wakes", "allah", "msians", "tomorrow", "instagram"], "authors": [], "text": "A+ A-\n\nNooryana Najwa Najib has urged Malaysians to spare a thought for former prime minister Najib Abdul Razak after his arrest earlier today.\n\n\"Let\u2019s just think of him this one time when he needs us the most.

This is the day Malaysians experienced the power of the ballot.\n\nAnger towards the current administration had brought them out in large numbers to cast their votes in the historic 14th general election.\n\nFew Malaysians would have thought they would live to see this day \u2013 the defeat of the formidable Umno-led BN/Alliance which had held unbroken power for 61 years.\n\nThis is the first time the country has witnessed a change of government since independence from the British in 1957.\n\nMalaysia is probably the only country in the world, apart from a handful of communist states, to have not undergone a regime change.\n\nPakatan Harapan's victory is even more remarkable because of the gerrymandering, the numerous attempts by the Election Commission to frustrate the opposition campaign, and the holding of the election in the middle of the week, which most likely resulted in a lower voter turnout.\n\nThe rout of BN was made possible by a Malaysian tsunami \u2013 a tide which comprised not just the major ethnic groups in the peninsula \u2013 Malays, Chinese and Indians - but also those in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nAt the end of the day, the redelineation, which BN pushed through weeks before the election, backfired.\n\nVoters, frustrated with various issues, made a beeline at polling stations nationwide to reverse the efforts by BN and its functionaries to steal this election.\n\nMore importantly, this election witnessed a swing among the Malays in favour of the opposition despite the scare-mongering and race-baiting.\n\nWith this, Malaysia has taken the first step of becoming a normal country.\n\nA normal country in which two or more coalitions would vie for power. A normal country where power now resided with the people, and not politicians. A normal country in which race and religion would not be an unalloyed obsession.\n\nNow the hard work begins. No one should be under the illusion that a new government would be able to reverse the rot that had taken root for decades.\n\nFor a country that is so divided, it would take time to heal the wounds, and for Malaysians to rebuild the trust for one another and for the many institutions that have failed them.\n\nCredit must also be given to those in BN such as Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin, Umno treasurer-general Salleh Said Keruak and BN strategic communications department director Abdul Rahman Dahlan who were gracious in accepting defeat, emphasising that the voice of the people was paramount.\n\nSimilarly, supporters of Harapan must also be gracious in victory.\n\nMay 9, 2018, is also a reminder to all politicians not to take the people for granted. It is a reminder that it is the rakyat who are their masters, and the politicians have been elected to serve, and not lord over them.\n\nIt would be wise for the incoming government to remember this.\n\nCongratulations, Malaysia.

But the journey has been perilous. In its two decades of operations, Malaysiakini has been raided by police numerous times, dragged to court and most recently faced the threat of seeing its founders incarcerated for their work.\n\nYet, it has also won numerous awards for its journalism and has a special place in the hearts of Malaysians the world over. More than 17 million people used the site to track the Malaysian election results on May 9 and a multitude more followed along on social media. Anwar Ibrahim, on his release from prison on May 16 after obtaining a royal pardon, specifically thanked Malaysiakini for its work and its journalism.\n\nI spoke to CEO Premesh Chandran to find out more about the Malaysiakini journey - and what comes after this remarkable chapter in its life.\n\nWhat was the genesis of Malaysiakini?\n\nSteven and I used to work at The Sun, and before that we were student activists. We often talked about how independent and free media propels a country forward, and we felt that independent media in Malaysia was the weak link.\n\nAfter Anwar Ibrahim was arrested in September 1998, a lot of people approached us, suggesting we start up an underground newspaper. So then I said, \u201cLook, the internet is coming in and the government has already promised not to censor the internet. I think an online thing would work.\u201d\n\nThis was very early days - think dial-up modems - and at the time most of the websites were just blogs.\n\nIn the 20 years you\u2019ve been around, you\u2019ve seen a lot of competition come and go. Yet, Malaysiakini has consistently been number one, and consistently the most trusted site in the country. Why is that?\n\nWe moved first and developed a large following very early on. And we were in multiple languages.\n\nWe really tried to run it professionally, and slowly, over time, we\u2019ve been able to build up linkages and support across the political divide. After the 2008 elections [in which the opposition made unprecedented gains], we also reported very independently on the state governments run by the opposition.\n\nI think we built up our brand very strongly over the years. And in 2002, we decided to go subscription. That was pivotal.\n\nAt the time, advertising was clearly not working out. So we had a choice to either go subscription or basically close down.\n\nNobody thought it would work but we decided to try it anyway. The idea there was: Who really wants Malaysiakini to survive? We felt our readers were our strongest backers. They would be the ones saying, \u201cHere, I will support you.\u201d\n\nIt was a tough route - not many people were using credit cards in those days, there was no such thing as PayPal, no subscription systems around.\n\nSo how did you make it work?\n\nWe did things like create our own prepaid cards. In those days, even prepaid cards were a rarity. And just a lot of marketing, getting the word out. A lot of people were paying in cash, paying in cheques, and we were figuring things out as we went along.\n\nI think not having a print product helped us because when you have a print newspaper, your focus is on that and online is a stepchild. So I think because we were only digital, that helped us focus only on digital and become really good at digital.\n\nPeople talk a lot about the Malaysiakini commitment to good journalism, but the technology part of your business is very underrated. Tell us a little bit about that.\n\nWe\u2019ve been investing in technology since 2001. Because we started very early, there were not a lot of systems we could buy. If we started today, it may not make much sense to build lots of our own technology - we could just get whatever is there.\n\nBut because there was nothing there back then, we had to build a lot of our technology ourselves. So we\u2019ve invested in our CMS, subscription system, advertising - now we work with Google - we\u2019ve got our own HR system, CRM. We\u2019ve done everything ourselves.\n\nYou were also an early mover into video, having spun out KiniTV a few years ago. What was the thinking behind that?\n\nWe actually launched it in 2006 and it was first called MalaysiakiniTV. At that time YouTube had just started, and the government promised broadband connections.\n\nWe felt video would be a way to really allow more people to connect. But the first three to four years were very disappointing. Broadband took a really long time to come in, people couldn\u2019t really watch without buffering, and the cost of equipment was high.\n\nIt was only much later, around 2012 and 2013 when mobile phones became much cheaper and bandwidth costs came down, that you could see a huge jump in people watching video online. I think we were a bit too early on that and because of that we were not able to generate much revenue so we kept it small - only about three to five people.\n\nBut some of the videos we did were very important. We broadcast a series of three to four public rallies in 2007 and 2008 [Hindraf, Bersih, Bar Council]. A lot of those videos got pirated on to CDs and distributed. It was great marketing for us.\n\nDid Malaysiakini find it hard to attract advertisers because of what it was?\n\nThat\u2019s been true from day one. Advertisers found it difficult to advertise because we are very political, we ask tough questions, the government attacks us a lot.\n\nOur advertising team would put up a proposal and we wouldn\u2019t be able to get the ad dollar.\n\nSo, we did earn ad money but if you look at our earnings per reader, it was much lower than what the mainstream guys were earning, even though we had a large audience.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve always done at Malaysiakini is keep our costs very low. Even top management here don't earn as much.\n\nWith the new government in place, do you see the ad market changing for you? Will it be easier for you to operate and do business?\n\nI think it will be definitely much easier; I think we will be getting more [advertising] campaigns.\n\nBut online advertising itself is problematic for publishers generally. Facebook takes a lot of the money, Google takes a lot of the money. So we need to think of the ad market as a globalised market, it\u2019s not just Malaysians competing. It\u2019s not me versus The Star or NST.\n\nThe previous political hurdles will no longer be there, but that doesn\u2019t mean we are going to earn millions and millions and millions of dollars.\n\nMalaysiakini editor-in-chief Steven Gan gives a speech in the Malaysiakini newsroom at about 4am on May 10. The team had just finished a marathon day at work that culminated in the biggest story of its existence - the 14th Malaysian general elections, which saw the BN government ousted after 61 years of rule. (Photo: Marc Lourdes)\n\nAs things stand today, what\u2019s the percentage of your revenue split between advertising and subscriptions?\n\nLast year, it was 70% ads and 30% subscriptions. Subscriptions have taken a bit of a hit; it used to be much more but has gone down a little bit.\n\nWhen people feel disillusionment in politics, our subscriptions tend to go down. Now that people are excited about politics, our subscriptions will go up.\n\nMalaysiakini has been fundamental to the first time we\u2019ve had a change in government in Malaysia. What does this mean for your sense of achievement and purpose?\n\nIn many cases, people work very, very hard but don\u2019t live to see the day. But to actually see it is very exhilarating and euphoric, almost surreal.\n\nWhat comes next for Malaysiakini?\n\nThe political and regulatory environment will be easier to handle; there\u2019ll be less business obstacles to us and we can go into more areas.\n\nBut the media field will be much more competitive. With any country in post-transition, we see this bloom of media. Every Tom, Dick and Harry wants to set up a news website or TV station. So I think the field is going to get really crowded.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve also seen in many countries, there\u2019s a honeymoon period - but it only lasts six to 12 months. We will obviously be reporting critically of the government. And then the honeymoon will be over. We\u2019re not under the illusion that we are going to be the golden boys forever.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not in our DNA to try to parrot the government and be the government\u2019s PR agency.\n\nDo you have plans for growing beyond Malaysia?\n\nWe\u2019ve always talked about Malaysia as being possibly a very interesting intellectual hub for both Southeast Asia and for Asia.\n\nWe are a melting pot, we have different languages here, different ethnic groups, different religions. We speak English, so we can be connected to the Western world.\n\nIt\u2019s a very fertile place for ideas and engagement, but has always been held back by a government that\u2019s less than democratic. So, with those obstacles removed, we can see a lot of intellectual discussions happening, not only about how Malaysia should be in the future but how Asia should be.\n\nSo, I think there is a possibility we can position Malaysia as kind of an intellectual centre and media centre for Asia. And maybe Malaysiakini has a role in that space.\n\nWhat are the most useful lessons you\u2019ve learned over the past 19 years?\n\nOne is to be consistent. We don\u2019t hold grudges. Mahathir [Mohamad, in his first stint as prime minister] tried to shut us down. But when he left and his voice was being silenced by his successor [Abdullah Ahmad Badawi], we gave him space because his views were important. So we\u2019re very consistent with our mission - that\u2019s one key thing.\n\nThe decision to rely on our readers and on subscription in hindsight was a good move. But we have also kept the Malay language site free, so it reaches a wide audience. So although we are talking about subscriptions, we aren\u2019t dogmatic about it. We\u2019re not saying that\u2019s the only way forward.\n\nAnother good lesson is that Steven and I have this division: he looks after editorial and I look after the business. It\u2019s very often that online media is started by journalists and editors, and they are really gung-ho about [doing] the best journalism in the world.\n\nWhat they end up doing is over-investing in the journalism part and under-investing in the technology, advertising, operations, etc - because everybody who is sitting at the management table are all editors and journalists.\n\nSo I think that a key lesson would be that if you want to be successful in media, you need a good editor, you need a good technology lead - that\u2019s really key - and you need someone looking at revenues, whether it\u2019s advertising or subscription.\n\nThese three key aspects you can\u2019t do without. Too many companies fail because it\u2019s unbalanced.\n\nMARC LOURDES is a Malaysian journalist and editor, and is among Asia\u2019s leading experts on digital news media operations.

minister, \u201cSaudara\u201d Lim Guan Eng\u2019s political career can be described as an amazing race, nothing less.\n\n\u201cFrom Penang to Putrajaya, from a sea of black ink, as we have much more money to spend (in Penang) to a sea of red ink (in Putrajaya),\u201d he said, comparing his 10-year stewardship of the Penang state government with his challenging Federal role.\n\nThe Penang state government, adhering to a philosophy of competency, accountability and transparency (CAT), was acknowledged in the auditor-general\u2019s report as the best financially managed state as it had doubled its asset reserves to RM1.83 billion and reduced its debts significantly to RM65 million \u2013 an achievement that seems more remarkable against the backdrop of the staggering RM1 trillion worth of national debt and liabilities.\n\nOn his job at the Federal level now, Lim sees it as about cutting down excesses.\n\n\u201cSo, I am going to be a very, very unpopular finance minister. I have no money to give, I am cutting down,\u201d the 57-year old minister told Bernama in an exclusive interview at his office.\n\nBut, he said it was absolutely fine to go down in history as the most \u2018unpopular\u2019 finance minister, \u201cas this process of cutting down, cleaning up and turning around the nation is for our children.\u201d\n\nEmphasising the magnitude of the financial fiasco created by the previous government through a state investment fund, he said: \u201c1MDB\u2019s (1Malaysia Development Bhd) last tranche of the RM5 billion 30-year bond, guaranteed by the Federal government, is due in the year 2039.\u201d\n\nRecalling his first day of reporting for duty as finance minister on May 22, Lim said he was given a 1MDB-related document to sign: \u201cI told them \u2018no, I am not going to sign this, bring me something else\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt was on the same day that he spilled the beans on the Ministry of Finance's (MoF) \u201cbailout\u201d of 1MDB\u2019s debt obligations since April 2017 to the tune of RM6.98 billion.\n\n\u201cWe want our children to live a better life than us. So, this fight is for our children because they deserve a better future than we have today. We need to make sure that we do not mortgage our children\u2019s future. They (the previous government) have done that for the last 10 years, at least,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Lim admitted that it would not have been possible without the people speaking out loudly, via the ballot box, at the 14th General Election, which ended Barisan Nasional\u2019s (BN) \u2018grip\u2019 on the country.\n\nHe believed that if not for the change in government, the \u201cRM1 trillion debt could have easily ballooned to even RM2 trillion or RM3 trillion, a level where no medicine can be prescribed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new Pakatan Harapan government knows exactly what to do (to tackle the problem),\u201d he said with an air of confidence, having turned the Penang state finances around.\n\n\u201cFrom that experience in Penang, we know what we need to do. The question is whether we can take that strain, that is the challenge. It is not going to be easy. But together, we can.\u201d\n\n'Investors want truth'\n\nOn criticism that the Pakatan Harapan government, especially the Finance Minister himself, was still talking as if it were still in the opposition by revealing details on the nation\u2019s financial health, especially the astounding mountain of debts, Lim was convinced that there was nothing wrong in telling the truth to the people, as well as, investors because that is what they really want to know.\n\n\u201cIt was the \u2018Don\u2019t tell them everything lah\u2019 mentality (previously). They (the previous government) are not used to this. We are telling you (everything) as it is. What you see is what you get. They massage the numbers; we don't massage the numbers. They repackage it, they do creative accounting; we do not subscribe to creative accounting.\n\n\u201cAnd, just because I am in the Federal government now, I am not going to be any different. This is my style. I can still walk into a street shop and have noodles.\n\n\u201cIt is a different league and ball game.

They were buying flats. Renting yachts. Hiring private jets. Partying,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wasn't happy with how my relationship was with Tarek at the time. We were supposed to be friends. But some people, when they receive a lot of money, they become crazy.\u201d\n\nPetroSaudi, he said, had no business taking on billion-dollar deals with anyone because it was a \u201cfake company\u201d without proper business activities or experience.\n\nPrior to the 2009 joint-venture, PetroSaudi's staff was limited to only a handful of secretaries in offices spread across Riyadh, Geneva and London, who would answer \u201cone or two phone calls a week\u201d, he said.\n\nThe only legitimate business activity undertaken by PetroSaudi was a deal with Venezuela, which eventually collapsed. The company also owned only two drillships, of which one - the 40-year-old Petrosaudi Discoverer - Justo said was so dilapidated and dirty that he refused to board it.\n\nThe only asset which PetroSaudi had at the time, according to Justo, was the ring to the name.\n\n\u201cPetroSaudi is a very nice name. When you hear PetroSaudi it is like Petronas or Petrobras. It sounded like a state company. But that was not the case. It was just a name that they bought.\n\n\u201cPrince Turki was a shareholder, but there was never ever any official link with the Saudi family, oil field or big Saudi oil firm. They just had a very nice name. That was their main asset,\u201d he said.\n\nParaside lost\n\nAfter leaving PetroSaudi, Justo moved to Koh Samui, Thailand where he married and started a family. He had already sold his assets and had begun building a mansion. It was meant to be retirement in paradise.\n\nHowever, he was still owed US$2 million by his former employers, which he was intent on recovering. When that failed, he turned to Clare Rewcastle-Brown, the editor of Sarawak Report, and a Malaysian media mogul.\n\nHe had passed the duo the email cache, which numbered about 230,000. Initially, he had asked the media mogul for the sum, but released it to the duo for free eventually.\n\nFollowing this, damning reports on how US$1 billion invested by 1MDB was abused began to surface, including how US$700 million was siphoned from the joint-venture with PetroSaudi, sparking domestic investigations on the deal.\n\nBy July that year, matters came to a head in Kuala Lumpur. This was the height of Malaysia\u2019s investigations into 1MDB and Malaysia\u2019s deputy prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin, attorney-general Abdul Gani Patail and a special branch deputy chief were all removed from office. Investigations ground to a halt.\n\nOver in Bangkok, Justo was arrested over his 2013 meeting with PetroSaudi player Patrick Mahony, purportedly involving blackmail. New Straits Times (NST) in its reports claimed that Justo had links with the Malaysian opposition of the time, and that news organisations had published articles based on the leaked emails after they were allegedly tampered with.\n\nAt the time, Rewcastle-Brown was repeatedly accused by Najib\u2019s henchmen of releasing the \u201ctampered\u201d material as part of a massive conspiracy to topple a legitimately elected prime minister.\n\nIn hindsight, Justo said he was a victim of corrupt Thai officials who were pliant to their Malaysian counterparts who wanted to discredit him and the emails at all cost.\n\n\u201cThey had to make me look like a very bad guy. A criminal. They even wanted me to say that (a local business paper) and Clare manipulated the data. It was never manipulated. I gave it to them for free.\n\n\u201cYes, in the beginning, I did ask for money that was owed to me. If I were to blackmail PetroSaudi, why would I just ask for US$2 million? I would sell it for US$50 million or maybe go to Najib\u2019s office and ask for US$100 million,\u201d he said.\n\nJusto said that he had no choice but to confess and cast others in bad light as ordered because he was threatened with the maximum 10 years jail term had he not complied.\n\nHe was freed in December 2016 after receiving a royal pardon, and in part due to intervention from the Swiss authorities. Since then, he has been rebuilding his life while pursuing criminal action against Obaid and Mahony through the Swiss justice system.\n\nOver the past week, Justo has met the MACC and Putrajaya\u2019s special 1MDB taskforce. Justo stressed that he was in Malaysia on his own expense, and will assist Malaysian investigators in any way possible.\n\nRELATED REPORT\n\nPetroSaudi confessions made under duress, says Justo",

It is likely that new electoral boundaries will be used in the impending general election.\n\nThe EC started a delineation review on 15 September 2016, and submitted its final report to Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak on 9 March 2018. This process was rushed and controversial \u2013 the Selangor state government filed a legal challenge in October 2016 seeking to nullify the EC\u2019s notice of redelineation, arguing that it violated the Federal Constitution in drawing new electoral boundaries.\n\nNajib will likely table it in Parliament in the March-April session. The redelineation proposal covers both federal and state constituencies and requires the approval of just 50 percent of Parliament, 111 votes, to be passed.\n\nSeveral commentaries have criticised the redelineation as guilty of ethnic gerrymandering. Focusing on ethnic imbalance, however, not only unnecessarily limits our understanding of the redelineation process, it distracts from the real damage of the redelineation process by using race as a smokescreen.\n\nLooking at this issue through race suggests that there may be winners and losers from this process; in reality, all Malaysians are losers if this redelineation exercise is allowed to proceed unchallenged.\n\nIn the election, voters cast two votes: one for representation at the state level (state assembly) and one at the federal level (Parliament). The state constituencies are nested within a larger federal constituency, so it is typical for 3-5 state constituencies to exist within one federal constituency.\n\nMalaysia practices a first-past-the-post system where a simple majority is decisive. No representation is allocated to the losing party, no matter whether they get 49.9 percent or 9.9 percent of the votes cast. This creates vote-seat disproportionality at the constituency level, where 49.9 percent of voters may be against the winner and yet have no representation. This effect is then magnified significantly across constituencies.\n\nThis was painfully evident in the previous election (GE13, 2013) where the BN coalition barely squeaked back into power. The opposition won 50.87 percent of the vote, but thanks to shamelessly biased gerrymandering of the constituencies, the BN\u2019s 47.37 percent was sufficient for it to win 133 out of 222 seats (59.9 percent) in Parliament.\n\nAs a result, the Parliament was not representative of the people. This disparity between votes obtained versus seats won means that many voters are under-represented or their votes are worthless. It violates a fundamental principle of equality and equal representation (or the \u201cone man, one vote\u201d principle).\n\nDemographic shifts, development and migration change the characteristics of constituencies over time. The Federal Constitution\u2019s Article 113 thus provides for a redelineation exercise, to be done at least eight years after the previous exercise.\n\nThe exercise is designed to scrutinise the current population of each constituency and rebalance them, in accordance with principles laid out in the Constitution, aiming for \u201capproximately equal\u201d apportionment and to avoid \u201cvote-seat disproportionality across parties\u201d so that the ballot value of each voter can be equal across all political parties, preserving the principle of \u201cone man, one vote\u201d.\n\nThe process begins with the EC informing the prime minister and Parliament and publishing a notice of the First Recommendations for redelineation through gazette and newspapers. After a period for feedback, objections, and inquiries, the EC will revise its proposed redelineation and publicise a Second Recommendations.\n\nAnother round of objections and inquiries ensue, after which the EC submits a final report to the Prime Minister to be presented in Parliament. After approval by Parliament, it will be presented to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, who will proclaim an order effective upon the dissolution of the current Parliament.\n\nThe Thirteen Schedule of the Constitution details the provisions for a redelineation exercise to be carried out by the EC. In particular, Clause 2 states: \"The following principles shall, as far as possible, be taken into account in dividing any unit of review into constituencies pursuant to the provisions of Articles 116 and 117:\n\n(a) While having regard to the desirability of giving all electors reasonably convenient opportunities of going to the polls, constituencies ought to be delimited so that they do not cross state boundaries and regard ought to be had to the inconvenience of state constituencies crossing the boundaries of federal constituencies;\n\n(b) Regard ought to be to the administrative facilities available within the constituencies for the establishment of the necessary registration and polling machines;\n\n(c) The number of electors within each constituency in a state ought to be approximately equal except that, having regard to the greater difficulty of reaching electors in the country districts and the other disadvantages facing rural constituencies, a measure of weightage for area ought to be given to such constituencies;\n\n(d) Regard ought to be had to the inconveniences attendant on alterations of constituencies, and to the maintenance of local ties.\"\n\nIf any of the above principles are not followed \u2013 for example, instances of constitutional non-compliance are left uncorrected without due justification, or worse, instances of constitutional non-compliance are aggravated by the changes proposed \u2013 then the redelineation exercise would be unconstitutional.\n\nMalapportionment: your votes are not equal\n\nMalapportionment is a manipulation of electorate size, which not only violates the moral democratic principle of \u201cone man one vote\u201d but also violates the constitutional principle spelled out in Thirteenth Schedule 2(c), which states that \u201cthe number of electors within each constituency in a State ought to be approximately equal\u201d (with one exception for rural constituencies \u2013 see below).\n\nThe typical example used to showcase the violation of this \u201cequal apportionment\u201d rule is the comparison between the electorate size of two federal constituencies: Kapar\u2019s 146,317 voters and Putrajaya\u2019s 17,627 voters. But the two federal constituencies do not reside in the same state and Putrajaya, being a separate unit of administration, is an exceptional case.\n\nA stronger case can be made by comparing malapportionment of constituencies in the same state (intra-state malapportionment), in particular because the Thirteenth Schedule 2(c) specifically mentions that the number of electors within each constituency in a state ought to be approximately equal.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at Penang, which is comprised entirely of urban constituencies (examining Penang enables us to make comparisons without the rural weightage clause exemption, which we address in further detail in a separate section below):\n\nFigure 1: Intra-state malapportionment in the state of Penang. The deviation, in percent, from the average size of the state constituencies (21,694 voters) is denoted by the colour.\n\nSeverely under-represented constituencies (those with an excessively large electorate, coloured in red) and severely over-represented constituencies (excessively small electorate, coloured in dark green) would have been outright unconstitutional if not for the two constitutional amendments in 1962 and 1973.\n\nPrior to the first amendment in 1962, the permissible range of deviation from the state average was capped at 15 percent. The 1962 amendment increased the range of permissible deviation from 15 percent to 33.33 percent. The cap was entirely removed in the 1973 amendment.\n\nWith the removal of quantified criteria, the deviation has skyrocketed from a maximum of 33.33 percent up to 92.25 percent (N34 Paya Terubong in Penang) and above.\n\nIn Peninsular Malaysia, the worst case of intra-state malapportionment (by deviation from the state average) is in Johor: 121.66 percent (N48 Skudai). This is a clear violation of the principle of \u201capproximately equal\u201d apportionment.\n\nIn Penang, intra-state malapportionment can be most clearly seen by comparing the largest state constituency, N34 Paya Terubong, and the smallest, N23 Air Putih, which are neighbouring and both urban.\n\nPaya Terubong has 41,707 voters, which is more than three times the size of Air Putih\u2019s 12,752 voters. N34 Paya Terubong exceeded the average electorate size in Penang (21,694 voters) by 92.25 percent. Such extreme deviation cannot be justified as \u201capproximately equal\u201d.\n\nAnother way of thinking about intra-state malapportionment is to calculate by the ratio of the largest constituency to the smallest constituency in the same state.\n\nIn Selangor, the ratio is 3.94, which means that a vote in the smallest federal constituency (P092 Sabak Bernam) has nearly four times the value of a vote in the largest federal constituency (P109 Kapar) in that same state. In other words, if you vote in P109 Kapar, your vote is worth merely a quarter of a vote compared to a voter in P092 Sabak Bernam.\n\nTable 1: Ratio between largest and smallest federal constituencies in various Malaysian states.\n\nIn no fewer than nine states, the ratio of the largest to the smallest federal constituency is more than two. The worst culprits are Selangor, Perak, and Johor. In Perak and Johor, a vote in the smallest federal constituency in each state has three times the value of a vote in the largest federal constituency.\n\nThis is a clear violation of the constitutional provision that \u201cthe number of electors within each constituency in a state ought to be approximately equal\u201d. While it is possible to argue that the ratio between the largest and smallest federal constituencies in Perlis (1.20 \u2013 see Table 1 above) is within acceptable limits of \u201capproximately equal\u201d, the same can\u2019t be said when the population of the largest constituency is more than three times the size of the smallest constituency in Johor (3.17), Perak (3.43), and Selangor (3.94).\n\nThe rural weightage clause\n\nApproximately equal apportionment is the rule, but one exception is allowed on the basis of area (land mass), where rural disadvantages are a necessary additional condition.\n\nSection 2(c) in the Thirteenth Schedule says, \u201c\u2026having regard to the greater difficulty of reaching electors in the country districts and the other disadvantages facing rural constituencies, a measure of weightage for area ought to be given to such constituencies\".\n\nSince rural areas are harder to access and their populations spread out across large areas, a rural constituency may cover a significantly larger area than an urban constituency in order to have the same number of voters as the urban constituency. However, at some point the constituency may simply get too big to be practical \u2013 hence, the rural weightage clause, which grants this exception to permit such a constituency to have fewer voters.\n\nThe EC, however, has (mis)interpreted this as \u201crural weightage\u201d \u2013 that rural constituencies should have fewer voters in proportion to urban constituencies, merely because they are rural constituencies, thus giving rural votes greater weight.\n\nThis clause pertaining to rural districts has been repeatedly used to justify electoral malpractice. If this rule was applied properly, we should expect all constituencies to have approximately the same number of voters, with the exception of the largest rural constituencies, which would have slightly fewer voters. In other words, the only constituencies that rural weightage should be applied to are the absolute largest constituencies.\n\nIn practice, there is minimal correlation between landmass and electorate size \u2013 rural weightage is applied to rural constituencies regardless of size.\n\nSome of these constituencies are very small. In Table 2 below, which lists four rural constituencies in Selangor, P094 Hulu Selangor and P113 Sepang have the largest land area amongst the four and yet they have electorate sizes that fall perfectly within the acceptable limits (coloured in yellow; less than 15 percent deviation from the state average).\n\nYet in the same state, we also see the much smaller P093 Sungai Besar and P092 Sabak Bernam (the state\u2019s smallest). If we combined P093 Sungai Besar and P092 Sabak Bernam, we would have a single constituency with 79,959 voters, which would be approximately 85 percent of the state average but in an area still only 55 percent the size of P094 Hulu Selangor. There is no basis, therefore, for P092 and P093 to be separate constituencies.\n\nTable 2: Comparison of four rural constituencies in Selangor.\n\nThis misapplication of rural weightage can also be seen in state constituencies. In Table 3, the three state constituencies of N06 Kuala Kubu Baharu, N05 Ulu Bernam, and N07 Batang Kali, are the largest in Selangor (by land area).\n\nIf the third largest, N07 Batang Kali, could have an electorate 5 percent larger than the state average, there is no justification for any of the smaller constituencies to be eligible for rural area weightage.\n\nN01 Sungai Air Tawar (the state\u2019s smallest constituency) simply cannot be eligible for rural weightage as it has less than half the electorate of N07 Batang Kali when the latter has more than twice its landmass.\n\nTable 3: Comparison of state constituencies in Selangor by land area.\n\nLikewise, while the rural clause justifies an exception for some rural areas, it does not justify the under-representation of urban areas. Thus, Section 2(c) cannot be used to justify excessively large constituencies \u2013 of which there are many.\n\nReferring back to Figure 1, the excessively large constituencies in Penang (coloured in red \u2013 N35 Batu Uban, N37 Batu Maung, N10 Seberang Jaya, N14 Machang Bubok, and N34 Paya Terubong) all deviated from the state average by more than 33.33 percent.\n\nThe clause is meant to ensure representation for rural voters and may make exception for a rural constituency small in electorate size but does not justify excessively large urban constituencies. Doing so is amounting to reducing representation for the voters in those areas.\n\nGerrymandering: Manipulation of electorate composition and severance of local ties\n\nGerrymandering is a manipulation of electorate composition to the advantage of one party. By deliberately arranging the constituency to advantage one party, gerrymandering enables politicians to choose their voters rather than the other way around.\n\nThis is particularly effective in \u201cFirst Past The Post\u201d systems, because (as noted above) of the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d nature of the system. The gerrymander only has to redistrict a small number of voters in order to win a seat; do this a few times and you produce a massive swing in the number of seats won. Because the changes can be very small, but the gain from cheating very high, it is very lucrative for parties and politicians to engage in it.\n\nThe constitution\u2019s Thirteenth Schedule 2(d) provides safeguards against gerrymandering by specifying that \u201cregard ought to be had to the inconveniences attendant on alterations of constituencies, and to the maintenance of local ties.\u201d Put simply, a constituency should represent an actual community of common interests, and not an arbitrary collection of citizens.\n\n\u201cInconveniences\u201d arising from the alteration of constituencies (including those arising specifically from the severing of local ties) can be grouped into three types:\n\nType 1: Constituencies unnecessarily cutting across local authority areas, causing municipalities or districts to be fragmented.\n\nType 2: Electoral boundaries cutting through and breaking up local communities or neighbourhoods.\n\nType 3: Constituencies combining communities with few ties and few common interests.\n\nAll three types of gerrymandering fail to adhere to the constitutional stipulation that electoral constituency should, as far as possible, maintain local ties.\n\nGerrymandering Type 1 involves constituencies that cross several local authority areas (local council, or Pihak Berkuasa Tempatan, PBT). The map below demonstrates cross-local authority areas in Johor that are constitutionally non-compliant with 2(d) in Thirteenth Schedule of the constitution. State constituencies cut across the jurisdictions of multiple local authorities (represented by the colours).\n\nMap 1: State constituencies (represented by the lines) in Johor state which cut across multiple local authority areas (represented by the colours).\n\nIn the example above, the state constituency N41 Puteri Wangsa (centre in the map) in the state of Johor incorporates sections of three separate local authorities: Majlis Perbandaran Kulai (Kulai Municipal Council, in red), Majlis Perbandaran Johor Bahru Tengah (Johor Bahru Tengah Municipal Council, in green), and Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru (Johor Bahru City Council, in blue).\n\nConstituencies that cut across two or more local authority areas create unnecessary complications that inconvenience both the voters and elected representatives. The voters in the same local authority area are likely to share common interests and live in the same neighbourhood, and form a logical single constituency. A constituency that cuts across multiple local authorities represents an arbitrary combination of communities with distinct interests, and forces the elected representative for the constituency to work with multiple local authorities to solve problems.\n\nGerrymandering Type 2 involves breaking up communities/neighbourhoods that share common interests and background.\n\nNeighbourhoods are cut up in oddly shaped boundaries and voters living in the same residential area find themselves voting in separate constituencies. To pick one example, the neighbourhoods between the constituencies of N44 Larkin and N45 Stulang (Map 2) found themselves partitioned by a zig-zag boundary drawn by the EC.\n\nMap 2: Boundary between two state constituencies in Johor state.\n\nZooming into the highlighted area, Map 3 shows the boundary should have been drawn as a straight line down the highway (Lebuhraya Tebrau). But instead, the EC draws a sharp turn into Jalan Dato Abdullah Tahir, then again at Jalan Dato Sulaiman, creating a zig-zag separating Taman Abad from their neighbouring communities.\n\nMap 3: Close-up of the boundary between two state constituencies in Johor state showing divided communities.\n\nIf the EC had drawn the boundary down the highway, the Taman Abad, Yahya Awal, and Wadi Hana communities on the left side of Lebuhraya Tebrau would be grouped into the same constituency, while the Taman Maju Jaya communities on the right side of the highway would be grouped into another constituency. The current proposal puts neighbourhoods on the same side of the highway in two different constituencies, and neighbourhoods on different sides of the highway in one constituency.\n\nMap 4: Arbitrary partitioning of townships of Banting and Jenjarom between three state constituencies. Click on the image for a larger view.\n\nAnother example can be found in Map 4 above. The townships of Banting and Jenjarom are arbitrarily partitioned in zig-zag style between N51 Sijangkang, N52 Banting (now renamed Teluk Datuk) and N53 Morib. The arbitrary zig-zags appear to be motivated by gerrymandering.\n\nThe deliberate movement of voters saw N52 Banting receiving 5,760 electors from N53 Morib and 4,804 electors from N51 Sijangkang, who are mostly Chinese and expected to be pro-opposition while 7,365 electors \u2013 mostly Malays and expected to be supportive of the ruling regime \u2013 are transferred from N52 Banting to N51 Sijangkang.\n\nWhile three constituencies were previously won by the opposition, these changes result in the packing of N52 Banting into a super-stronghold for the opposition party DAP and cracking of N51 Sijangkang and N53 Morib to make them more winnable for the United Malays National Organisation (Umno).\n\nGerrymandering Type 3 involves arbitrary grouping of communities which have minimal common interests into one constituency.\n\nMap 5: Misallocation of Pulau Ketam into N45 Selat Klang instead of N46 Pelabuhan Klang.\n\nA clear example is Pulau Ketam (highlighted areas in Map 5) in the state of Selangor. Grouping the Pulau Ketam community with the urban strip (into N45 Selat Klang) has had serious implications for the electors in real life.\n\nAs Pulau Ketam islanders make up only 13 percent of the state constituency, they complain of being neglected by the elected representative, who naturally focuses her energy on the 87 percent majority on the mainland, which has no social or economic ties and few common interests with the islanders.\n\nThis negligence is magnified at the federal level as the 4,770 electors on the islands constitute an even tinier minority, just 3 percent in P109 Kapar (146,317 electors), the nation\u2019s largest constituency in terms of number of voters.\n\nThe Pulau Ketam community should have been incorporated into N46 Pelabuhan Klang as its economic and social activities are closely tied to the maritime township of Port Klang and by extension, the Klang town. The EC\u2019s failure in making such an intuitive correction preserves non-compliance with the Constitution, defying the purpose of a delimitation review under Article 113(2).\n\nHidden hands: Exclusion from redelineation and illegal changes\n\nIn many cases, extreme malapportionment and gerrymandering of constituencies already exist, and yet not corrected as the constituencies are excluded from the redelineation exercise i.e. when no changes are proposed. In the current redelineation exercise, not all constituencies will have their boundaries redrawn. Many constituencies have been excluded and will be left untouched.\n\nMap 6: State constituencies in Penang state.\n\nOn the left, Map 6 shows the state constituencies in Penang which are entirely excluded from the redelineation exercise. No justification for their exclusion has been provided.\n\nOn the right, Map 6 shows the levels of malapportionment in the same state (the colour-scheme being identical as Figure 1). Given the severity of intra-state malapportionment in Penang, there is no reason why these constituencies should be excluded.\n\nThere are two severely over-represented state constituencies (dark green in colour) and five severely under-represented constituencies (red in colour).\n\nTheir exclusion from the redelineation exercise is baffling because the existing malapportionment is severe. The EC is failing to perform its duty, as mandated by the constitution, to redelineate to correct extreme malapportionment.\n\nLogically, N34 Paya Terubong (red, centre of Penang Island) should have ceded some of its voters to N23 Air Putih (dark green, directly on top of N34 Paya Terubong). Since the former is excessively large, the latter excessively small, and they are next to each other, it is a straightforward change.\n\nThis failure to correct an obvious violation of the constitutional principle laid out in the Thirteenth Schedule is unconstitutional. The Election Commission fails its duty by excluding these constituencies from the redelineation review.\n\nThis is not an exception. The exclusion of constituencies is widespread. At least 96 federal constituencies and 246 state constituencies are excluded from the redelineation proposed by the EC, thus sustaining pre-existing malapportionment and gerrymandering and defeating the purpose of the redelineation exercise.\n\nTable 4: Exclusion of constituencies up to 2nd Recommendations. \u201cExcluded\u201d refers to the constituencies that are excluded from the redelineation exercise (no changes proposed), \u201cReversed\u201d refers to constituencies with changes proposed in the 1st Recommendations but reversed in the 2nd Recommendations (changes are cancelled, so ultimately no changes proposed), and \u201cIncluded\u201d refers to constituencies which are included in the redelineation exercise.\n\nThe exclusion viewed in terms of actual numbers of voters that are moved is even more dramatic. In the state of Selangor, despite significant malapportionment and gerrymandering in the existing constituency boundaries, only about 2 percent of voters will actually be moved in the redelineation proposal.\n\nTable 5: Number of voters that are actually moved in the state of Selangor after the 2nd Recommendations proposed by the Election Commission.\n\nBut does the EC really not change the boundaries of these excluded constituencies? Shockingly, unconstitutional pre-delineation changes (changes which are not part of the redelineation exercise) are also being made to polling districts and electoral boundaries!\n\nMap 7: Boundaries of N37 Batu Maung state constituency in Penang state.\n\nMap 7 shows that the boundaries of a state constituency in Penang, N37 Batu Maung. The boundaries are demonstrably different between the years 2009 and 2016, despite the Election Commission\u2019s exclusion of N37 Batu Maung from the redelineation exercise.\n\nThe only explanation is that the changes were discreetly made by the EC prior to the commencement of the redelineation exercise. An estimated 96 percent of the federal constituencies in Perak, 77 percent in Johor, and 69 percent in Penang are affected.\n\nThese pre-delineation changes effectively render the redelineation exercise meaningless as most changes were introduced before redelineation. More importantly, because they are not done in accordance with the procedure for changing electoral boundaries spelled out in the constitution, any pre-delineation exercise changes are therefore unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nAnother sneaky change made by the EC is the breaking up of polling districts. This was done during the redelineation exercise but is no less illegal.\n\nThe EC is empowered to alter the division of a constituency into polling districts under the Election Act 1958. The EC may move polling districts into different constituencies, but it does not have the power to divide one polling district into two polling districts scattered across two constituencies.\n\nAdditionally, the EC must use the same electoral roll throughout the redelineation process. By altering polling districts in the delineation process, the EC has directly violated Section 3 of the Thirteenth Schedule which reads, \u201cFor the purposes of this part, the number of electors shall be taken to be as shown on the current electoral rolls\u201d.\n\nIn Sabah, the number of voters in the polling district named Lok Kawi under the state constituency N24 Tanjung Keramat (previously named N24 Tanjung Dumpil) is noticeably different. It was split from 4,574 voters into 3,550. The difference (1,024) was transferred to another state constituency, N23 Petagas.\n\nFigure 2: Polling district Lok Kawi in September 2016 when the EC publicized the 1st Recommendations.\n\nFigure 3: Polling district Lok Kawi in March 2017 when the EC publicised the 2nd Recommendations.\n\nIn N23, two polling districts (Sailan and Putatan) were renamed and reconfigured with the additional 1,024 voters from N24 to become three new polling districts.\n\nThis is procedurally wrong but also has real consequences for the voters. The original 4,574 voters would not know which constituency they would be in (one of the 3,550 who stay put, or one of the 1,024 who were moved) because there are no new polling district maps to inform them \u2013 new polling district maps are normally issued alongside new electoral rolls.\n\nIn any event, the EC must use the same electoral roll throughout the entire redelineation exercise. When they break up a polling district, they have altered the electoral roll, thereby making the redelineation exercise unconstitutional as per Section 3 of the Thirteenth Schedule.\n\nConclusion: Demand electoral system reforms\n\nThe redelineation proposed by the EC severely violates the provisions contained in the Thirteenth Schedule of Malaysia\u2019s Constitution. Consequently, the entire redelineation exercise is unconstitutional. Worse, the outcome of GE14 will certainly not be genuinely representative of the Malaysian people.\n\nAs things stand, the legal avenues to challenge the redelineation exercise have almost been exhausted.\n\nMultiple legal challenges by the Selangor state government, Penang state government, and members of the public have been unsuccessful.\n\nActivists and a former senior judge expressed disappointment over the Federal Court\u2019s ruling. The EC rushed to submit the final recommendation to the prime minister, who will table it in Parliament very soon.\n\nElectoral watchdog Bersih 2.0 has called for a Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) on the electoral system. The RCI can investigate and propose reforms to the electoral system, promote vote-seat proportionality and political inclusion of all communities and segments in Malaysia, and reform the Election Commission.\n\nThe ruling BN has stonewalled Bersih 2.0\u2019s demand for free and fair elections. The best hope for implementing this RCI is the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan, led by former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad. The coalition\u2019s recently launched election manifesto is promising, with institutional reforms on the cards, but stopped short of pledging electoral reform and local election.\n\nWith recent court decisions rendering objections to the proposed redelineation all but moot now, existing malapportionment and gerrymandering will not be corrected.\n\nIt will be at least eight more years till the next redelineation exercise. If the next incoming government is serious in cleaning up malapportionment and gerrymandering, proper diagnosis of and reforms to the electoral system are necessary. The RCI, which can be immediately convened, is a big step forward to that direction.\n\nGood, honest governance requires genuine accountability from our elected politicians. Accountability requires free and fair elections. Free and fair elections can only happen in the absence of malapportionment and gerrymandering, with redelineation carried out in accordance with the constitution and in obedience with the law.\n\nFor reforms to happen, it is paramount for the Malaysian people and interest groups to demand electoral system reforms and exert influence on politicians to act and put electoral system reform on their agenda.\n\nOOI KOK HIN is an analyst at the Penang Institute.\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini.", "news": "Malaysiakini", "url": "https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/417270", "language": "eng", "summary": "This article explains in detail exactly how and why the redelineation exercise is unconstitutional and illegal.\nThe state constituencies are nested within a larger federal constituency, so it is typical for 3-5 state constituencies to exist within one federal constituency.\nThe Thirteen Schedule of the Constitution details the provisions for a redelineation exercise to be carried out by the EC.\nOn the left, Map 6 shows the state constituencies in Penang which are entirely excluded from the redelineation exercise.\nThese pre-delineation changes effectively render the redelineation exercise meaningless as most changes were introduced before redelineation.", "title": "How GE14 is being rigged through redelineation", "date": "03-26-2018", "top-image": "https://i.malaysiakini.com/1046/28c64c63fba9540d8998336db7c7eec3.jpg"}, {"keyword": ["request", "jho", "facts", "msian", "line", "low", "claimed", "statements", "team", "malaysian", "businessperson", "say", "macau", "1mdb", "cops"], "authors": [], "text": "A+ A-\n\nMacau police have disputed the veracity of recent media statements made by Malaysian police following the latter\u2019s request for help in arresting 1MDB-linked businessperson Low Taek Jho.\n\nIn a statement issued to local journalists received by Malaysiakini, the Macau Police Department said it regretted how Malaysian police had spread \u201cnews about Macau that is not in line with facts,\u201d but did not elaborate further.\n\n\u201cThe Macau branch of China Interpol has received a request from the relevant country and has made a reply.\n\n\u201cHowever, the person responsible for the relevant country\u2019s national police force\u2019s recent statements to the media regarding news about Macau is not in line with facts.

But in both countries there\u2019s a cost to telling these stories\n\nTwo of the region\u2019s finest news organisations are under assault, showing once again that speaking truth to power in Asia is an enterprise fraught with risk. Malaysian news site Malaysiakini has been ordered by the appellate court to pay 350,000 ringgit (US$88,400) in a libel suit brought by an Australian mining company. In the Philippines, financial regulators revoked the business licence of Rappler, claiming it violated rules against foreign ownership.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s High Court had dismissed the suit against Malaysiakini in 2016. The judge ruled the site had been motivated by public interest when it reported a press conference by villagers who alleged they had been poisoned by the mine\u2019s activities. But on January 11, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision, declaring that Malaysiakini\u2019s reporting was reckless and one-sided. Lacking the deep pockets of larger media companies, the 18-year-old site has launched an appeal for donations to pay the damages and costs.\n\nAs for the six-year-old Rappler, even if the Securities and Exchange Commission was technically correct in spotting an irregularity \u2013 which is debatable \u2013 the authorities\u2019 punitive action was clearly excessive, potentially silencing one of the country\u2019s most viewed news sites. As a result, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines dubbed January 19 as \u201cBlack Friday\u201d in protest against this and other attacks on media freedom.\n\nThese moves are taking place at a time when the two countries are in desperate need of fearless, independent scrutiny of the powerful. Malaysia is heading into an election bound to be tested by money, trickery and racial and religious demagoguery. The Philippines continues to be rocked by extrajudicial killings in President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s merciless war on drugs. Malaysiakini and Rappler are among the most forthright and persistent local voices telling these stories.\n\nDuterte\u2019s office has tried to play down the January 15 announcement. His spokesman Harry Roque said on Wednesday Rappler\u2019s suppression did not amount to a violation of its journalists\u2019 rights to free speech. \u201cThey can still become bloggers, that is clear,\u201d he said.\n\nThat statement may resonate with social media users who equate online freedom with their ability to tweet their thoughts and post their pictures. But, as Roque knows full well \u2013 he is a human rights lawyer who was active in the global Media Legal Defence Initiative network \u2013 freedom of expression is about more than the individual\u2019s right to speak. It is also about people\u2019s right to receive the information and ideas they need for collective self-government.\n\nFor this, we can\u2019t depend only on the posts of individual, unpaid bloggers. The goings-on of any modern society are too complex for solo part-timers to make sense of on their own. We also need organised, full-time teams of truth-seekers if we are to have any chance against powerful individuals and organisations with considerable capacity to conceal and deceive. That\u2019s where professional news media are supposed to come in.\n\nOf course, many people have grown justifiably sceptical about news media\u2019s claims to serve the public interest. Across Asia and the world, most journalism is produced by organisations whose professional missions are routinely compromised by their owners\u2019 pecuniary or political interests. Unlike licensed professions such as medicine and law, in which group practices tend to be owned and run by the professionals themselves, most journalistic enterprises are not controlled by members of the profession but by businessmen \u2013 including increasingly diversified conglomerates whose main interests are in property, telecommunication and other non-media sectors.\n\nIn many cases, owners do not even bother to conceal conflicts of interest. Indonesian oligarchs, for example, make no bones about using their television news stations to promote their bids for elected office. The owners and managers of The Times of India, the world\u2019s largest English-language daily, brazenly champion advertiser-friendly infotainment over public interest journalism.\n\nBut this is precisely why the fates of Malaysiakini and Rappler matter. Both were founded and continue to be controlled by veteran journalists. They have been structured to give their editors total professional autonomy internally, even if they can\u2019t always protect themselves from external pressures.\n\nJournalist-owned media are a vital part of a healthy, diverse media system. There is a smattering of them across the region, such as Hong Kong\u2019s CitizenNews, Taiwan\u2019s The Reporter and India\u2019s The Wire. Most of these are non-profit organisations, reliant on grants and donations. Therefore, even within this small fraternity, Malaysiakini and Rappler are exceptional \u2013 they have aimed, with some success, to be commercially viable, even as they reject corporate ownership. Anyone who bemoans the domination of media by businesses where professional journalists are on tap, not on top, should be rooting for these two insurgent sites.\n\nMalaysiakini and Rappler are both progressive sites that bank on readers\u2019 willingness to engage in public affairs. But that resource is also under threat as people\u2019s attention is fatigued by incessant attacks on free speech and human rights. Political scientists have observed the world slumping into a kind of \u201cdemocratic recession\u201d in recent years. When citizens repeatedly see leaders getting away with obvious abuses, it is natural to become blas\u00e9 about repression.\n\nMalaysiakini editor Steven Gan sees this happening in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cWe have a prime minister who has been alleged to be running a kleptocracy, and yet it is hard for anyone to dislodge him. Because of that, people are giving up, like there is no light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he told me. In ju-jitsu style, though, Malaysiakini hopes to use its current plight as a way to activate the public \u2013 hence its fundraising drive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crisis and opportunity,\u201d agreed Maria Ressa, chief executive of Rappler, whose supporters have so far been vocal in their outrage. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t get our day in court, if it\u2019s not as fair as it should be, our government is sensitive to public opinion.\u201d\n\nAlongside their struggles against state coercion, each of these sites has to try to reverse the public\u2019s growing dread that with power comes impunity. Their current travails are therefore not just a test for media freedom, but also of their societies\u2019 capacity to hope. \u25a0\n\nCherian George is a professor of media studies at Hong Kong Baptist University.

Otherwise, RAGM can take winding-up proceedings against Malaysiakini.\u201d\n\nNeither Gan nor Premesh Chandran, the publisher, would speculate on whether the appellate decision was reversed at the request of the government. However, over the years, the relationship between Putrajaya, the seat of the Malaysian government and the alternative news outlet, the country\u2019s most influential, has been fractious at best, and hostile at worst.\n\nThe decision by the Appeal court to reverse the lower court ruling exonerating the news poral has set tongues wagging over whether Najib ordered Malaysia\u2019s notoriously malleable courts to put Malaysiakini out of business prior to what political analyst say may be a tough election for the ruling Barisan Nasional, or national coalition.\n\nMalaysiakini has, since its inception 18 years ago, been a particular thorn in the government\u2019s side, attracting hostility from Najib and members of his cabinet.

It is very worrying to see this trend where first-instance justice decisions concerning press freedom are reversed by the Appeal Court. It gives the impression of a pro-government court whose decisions are politically motivated, and whose ultimate goal is to muzzle whistle-blowers and overly curious journalists.\u201d\n\nThe case brought by RAGM has its roots in a press conference that Malaysiakini and another website, Free Malaysia Today, (FMT) were invited to cover in Raub, a small town in Pahang state north of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe use of sodium cyanide, a known toxic chemical, to extract gold from tailings, was alleged to have caused a variety of health problems among the villagers of Bukit Koman, a village near Raub. After Malaysiakini published three news reports and two video clips, on Sept. 5, 2012, RAGM sued the news portal for defamation.\n\nThe company said that it had taken all reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of the workers and residents, dismissing allegations that sodium cyanide was hazardous to Bukit Koman residents and arguing that \u201cunsubstantiated and baseless allegations\u201d had confused the villagers and protesters.\n\nRAGM\u2019s beneficial owner is said to be Peninsular Gold, whose chairman and main shareholder is a politically well-connected Malaysian capitalist, Andrew Kam Tai Yeow. Kam was secretary-general of the Malaysian Chinese Association, the ethnic Chinese political party in the Barisan Nasional or ruling national coalition in the 1960s. Furthermore, RAGM enjoyed preferential tax status. It has since ceased operations and started liquidation proceedings.\n\nIn 2016, the High Court dismissed RAGM\u2019s suit and said it had failed to prove malice. Eight months later, the appellate court overturned the High Court ruling and said that Malaysiakini\u2019s defense of its reportage didn\u2019t hold up.\n\n\u201cThe settlement offered by RAGM\u2019s lawyer, Cecil Abraham, and the gold mine, to FMT required only an apology, but when it came to Malaysiakini, they wanted an apology and money,\u201d said a source who declined to be named. \u201cDuring the court hearing, [Abraham]s and the gold mine used FMT\u2019s apology against Malaysiakini. They claimed that FMT had apologized, but not Malaysiakini, and therefore Malaysiakini was being indolent and irresponsible.\n\n\u201cRAGM\u2019s lawyers failed to mention that they had demanded both an apology and a huge sum in damages from Malaysiakini. Clearly, the action by Cecil and the gold mine was to bleed the paper.\u201d\n\nA year after the protest march, three individuals who had led the rally and were also members of the Ban Cyanide Action Group (BCAC) were sued for defamation, by RAGM.\n\nThey were the chairman, Wong Kim Hoong, vice-chairman, Hue Shieh Lee, and secretary, Hue Fui How. RAGM claimed that the three had defamed them through their statements in two news articles, which both Malaysiakini and FMT had published.\n\nWhen Wong and Hue Fui How apologized to RAGM in open court, the company withdrew its suit. Hue Shieh Lee elected to continue her legal battle, and in 2016, the High Court ruled that RAGM had failed to prove that her statement against the gold mine, was a malicious falsehood.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for RSF to accuse the Court of Appeal of issuing a judgment to prevent the villagers from demanding compensation for their damaged health,\u201d said RSF\u2019s representative Bastard. \u201cHowever, the facts are clear: villagers will think twice before asking for compensation. This is a crude example of how violations of press freedom can affect every aspect of every society. This is why RSF firmly condemns the judgment by the Court of Appeal and shows its full support to Malaysiakini reporters, who were just trying to do their work \u2013 as the High Court recognized in the first instance.\u201d\n\nVillagers, he said, \u201ccan let independent local and foreign journalists investigate on their damaged health, so that awareness can be raised around their case.\u201d\n\nThere are three strands to this story. The harassment of Malaysiakini is not just an attack on press freedom. Its punishment is also a warning to other newspapers to tread warily, when reporting on Najib and UMNO.\n\nThe Appeal court verdict is also a means of intimidating the general public. Those who dare to protest an injustice, or the effects of pollution in their locality, or corruption, or become a whistle-blower, will find themselves subject to a lawsuit, with substantial costs, in addition to incarceration.\n\nAs Malaysians go to the polls this year, they know that a free press, which can report without fear or favor, is a fundamental requirement for democracy; but this is the least of Najib\u2019s concerns.\n\nSarawak Report\u2019s editor, Clare Rewcastle-Brown, in an article titled, \u201cWithout A Free Media Malaysia Will Slide Backwards Fast,\u201d, said \u201cThe difference between being a modern, progressive country and a tin-pot regime, where potential investors fear they cannot rely on the rule of law, can be quantified by the extent to which there is a free media and a government that can tolerate criticism.\n\n\u201cIf Malaysia starts to use the courts to close down media that is doing its job, and airing the grievances and concerns of the people, then the world will start to recognize it as a wild country which is only suitable for risk takers and resource-grabbers who are willing to risk losing their investment. The rest will steer clear. That would be a tragedy for a country which has made so much progress and could have a great future\u201d.\n\nRSF\u2019s Bastard said, \u201cIntimidation of journalists, humiliation, harassment and denial of access to information are common practices amongst government officials around the world who want to muzzle fearless journalists.\n\n\u201cMalaysiakini is recognized as an independent news outlet which doesn\u2019t let its editorial line to be dictated by the government. This is precisely what is press freedom.\n\n\u201cDenouncing powerful people when it is necessary and legitimate in a report should not lead to reprisals. This is also totally unacceptable. And this is all the truer in an electoral context.\u201d\n\nNajib has learned from the previous general-election that he must tie-up many loose ends, before the country\u2019s 14th General Election (GE-14), which must be called by August. Gagging Malaysiakini is perhaps one of those \u201cloose ends.\u201d", "news": "The Asia Sentinel", "url": "https://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/malaysiakini-imperiled-lawsuit-reversal/", "language": "eng", "summary": "It is very worrying to see this trend where first-instance justice decisions concerning press freedom are reversed by the Appeal Court.\nAfter Malaysiakini published three news reports and two video clips, on Sept. 5, 2012, RAGM sued the news portal for defamation.\nIn 2016, the High Court dismissed RAGM\u2019s suit and said it had failed to prove malice.\nEight months later, the appellate court overturned the High Court ruling and said that Malaysiakini\u2019s defense of its reportage didn\u2019t hold up.\nThe Appeal court verdict is also a means of intimidating the general public.", "title": "Malaysia\u2019s Leading News Portal Imperiled by Lawsuit Reversal \u2013 Asia Sentinel", "date": "01-20-2018", "top-image": "https://d1clnn1l7s2lhf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15855356926_b8787db1f6_z.jpg"}, {"keyword": ["meeting", "members", "minister", "asked", "prime", "president", "advice", "umno", "mahathir", "running", "zahid"], "authors": ["Ho Kit Yen", "Fmt Reporters"], "text": "The acting Umno president refutes a statement made by the prime minister that he had asked for advice during their June 7 meeting.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Umno acting president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi today denied he had sought Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s advice on how to manage Umno when they met in Putrajaya earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI have never asked his advice\u2026 My friends and I know how to manage our party,\u201d Malaysiakini quoted him as saying at a press conference in Kota Bharu, Kelantan, this afternoon.\n\nThe report said Zahid, who is running for president in the upcoming Umno general assembly, declined to elaborate on what was discussed during the closed-door meeting with Mahathir on June 7.\n\nMahathir, however, had said a day after the meeting that Zahid had sought pointers on how to run the party.\n\nEarlier today, former Umno leader Khairuddin Abu Hassan claimed Zahid had pleaded with him to arrange that meeting with Mahathir, and that it was not Mahathir who had requested the meeting as claimed by Zahid.\n\n\u201cAfter he pleaded with me to meet Mahathir, I arranged for him to meet the prime minister,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairuddin also rejected Zahid\u2019s claim during a speech to Selangor Umno members yesterday that Mahathir had asked Umno members to join PPBM.\n\n\u201cHe (Zahid) is a liar.

Jabatan-jabatan agama yang terlibat juga mendiamkan diri seolah-olah mahu melepaskan diri daripada tanggungjawab ini.\n\nProvokasi saya telah menghasilkan jawapan yang ditunggu oleh masyarakat Islam di negara ini yang semakin ramai memandang serong dan negatif terhadap sekolah tahfiz persendirian. Masih tidak ada kawalan berkesan terhadap pertumbuhannya.\n\nLangkah kerajaan untuk mengawal selia sekolah tahfiz supaya tidak terasing daripada sistem pendidikan yang ditetapkan seperti yang dinyatakan oleh Mujahid - itulah yang menjadi harapan masyarakat Islam di negara ini.\n\nKejayaan sekolah tahfiz melahirkan huffaz profesional adalah terpencil. Banyak anak-anak kita yang akan menjadi korban dan membuang masa di sekolah tahfiz persendirian yang masih di luar kawalan.\n\nSekolah tahfiz persendirian sudah menjadi perdagangan para ustaz. Saya ingin menarik perhatian Mujahid sebab yang mendorong saya menggesa ia ditutup dulu.\n\nKehendak ibu bapa, eksploitasi ustaz\n\n- Seorang rakan peguam saya di Pulau Pinang mengendalikan satu kes di mana seorang ustaz telah menukarkan tanah yang diwakafkan kepadanya, tanpa surat perjanjian, untuk membuka sekolah tahfiz kepada namanya.\n\nKes belum selesai dan banyak lagi kes penyelewengan dan penyalahgunaan kuasa seumpama ini yang mengambil kesempatan daripada sentimen agama.\n\n- Murid-murid sekolah tahfiz dieksploitasi untuk menjual buku-buku agama dan mengutip derma daripada orang ramai. Ramai yang menunggu di hadapan bank-bank, mengutipnya di kedai-kedai mamak, serta dari rumah ke rumah - cara sama oleh kumpulan Al-Arqam suatu masa dahulu.\n\n- Kalangan ibu bapa yang telah berjaya dalam hidup menghantar anak mereka ke sekolah tahfiz dengan kepercayaan mempunyai anak huffaz akan membantu membasuh dosa mereka dan jika mati, mayat tidak akan hancur.\n\n(Mayat Joseph Stalin dan Mao Zedong tidak hancur dan disimpan di Moscow dan Beijing. Mayat sami Buddha yang terkenal juga disimpan di Thailand dan sesekali dikeluarkan untuk tontonan ramai. Apa perlunya mayat tidak hancur?)\n\n- Banyak tragedi berlaku di sekolah agama bukan kerajaan. Selain daripada kebakaran, kemalangan dan penderaan, hukuman dan tekanan juga dikenakan ke atas pelajar oleh ustaz yang tidak mempunyai latihan pendidikan yang sempurna dan profesional.\n\nAnak-anak yang masih muda membuang masa di sekolah-sekolah ini yang tidak mempunyai kokurikulum dan sistem pendidikan akademik yang moden.\n\n- Sekolah tahfiz mula bertumbuh ustaz yang tidak mempunyai nilai ekonomi menyedari inilah satu cara mudah untuk mendapat sedekah atau memperdagangkan agama.\n\n(Ini juga akan diwarisi oleh murid-murid mereka yang juga nanti tidak mempunyai nilai komersial)\n\nMahathir, Mujahid, Maszlee\n\nPejabat-pejabat agama negeri tidak berani bertindak kerana sensitiviti agama dan menghormati golongan yang berjubah dan berkopiah putih.\n\nKerajaan BN pimpinan Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad dulu berani mencabar sensitiviti pemimpin agama, ulama-ulama yang tidak relevan dan juga tokoh-tokoh politik Islam yang karut. Beliau ikhlas mahu mengubah pemikiran umat Islam negara ini agar mampu menghadapi cabaran zaman dengan membina pendidikan agama dan indoktrinasi Islam yang bersifat universal, progresif, dinamik dan profesional.\n\nBeliau membina institusi-institusi Islam yang bertujuan membangunkan imej agama ini bukan saja di kalangan umat Islam tetapi juga bukan Islam di negara ini.\n\nSelepas beliau bersara, tidak ada lagi perdana menteri yang sanggup memerangi aliran pemikiran Islam yang jumud, kolot dan mundur ini dalam bidang politik, ekonomi dan keilmuan. Program agama di TV dan radio mengutamakan komersial dan menjalankan indoktrinasi doa untuk ke syurga.\n\nUmno tunduk kepada hukum hudud PAS, menyebabkan orang bukan Islam terutama MCA merasa mereka dikhianati Umno yang sekian lama menjadi kawannya. Orang Cina pula menolak UMNO.\n\nAlhamdulillah setelah Mahathir kembali sebagai perdana menteri, beliau mendapat dua orang sarjana Islam yang dinamik dan progresif iaitu Mujahid dan Menteri Pelajaran Dr Maszlee Malik.\n\nSaya percaya dua menteri ini yang mempunyai latar belakang akademik yang seimbang dan boleh menjadi contoh pembinaan masyarakat Islam yang berkualiti dan terhormat di negara ini.\n\nMereka juga boleh meminta bantuan untuk memajukan Islam yang sihat daripada intelektual Islam yang terhormat di negara ini, seperti pakar motivasi Datuk Mohd Fadzilah Kamsah, Mufti Perlis Datuk Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, bekas Ketua Pengarah IKIM Dr Ismail Ibrahim dan bekas Pengerusi Bank Islam Dr Abdul Halim Ismail.\n\nAdalah menjadi harapan saya agar program agama di TV dan radio mempunyai penasihat yang tidak berasaskan komersial dan doktrin doa sebagai jalan ke syurga semata-mata.\n\nCabaran zaman sekarang tidak boleh hanya dijawab dengan doa sepanjang masa. Doa tanpa usaha adalah khayal dan usaha tanpa doa adalah bongkak.\n\nJalan ke syurga bagi anak-anak Islam masa depan adalah dengan pencapaian cemerlang dalam semua bidang ilmu termasuk penguasan Bahasa Inggeris yang baik yang boleh meninggikan martabat orang Islam di negara sendiri.\n\nBahasa Arab tidak lagi mempunyai nilai sebagai bahasa ilmu kecuali dalam bidang agama. Mana ada orang Arab yang terkenal di dunia dalam bidang profesional kerana bahasa Arab sendiri terbantut kemajuannya dalam bidang ilmu.\n\nOrang kita tidak berani berterus-terang dalam hal ini kerana telah menyekutukan Arab dengan Islam. Anak-anak Melayu lebih maju di bidang profesional berbanding orang Arab yang hanya maju dalam bidang berbunuhan sesama sendiri.\n\nTAN SRI ZAINUDDIN MAIDIN ialah bekas menteri penerangan dan bekas ketua pengarang Kumpulan Utusan Melayu.

itu, ketua menteri Pulau Pinang Lim Guan Eng menyatakan kekecewaan terhadap SPRM kerana tidak menyokong pengisytiharan aset awam untuk menteri.\n\n\"Saya faham ada risiko keselamatan jika anggota keluarga pemegang jawatan mengisytiharkan aset mereka kepada orang ramai, tetapi sekurang-kurangnya para pemegang jawatan itu sendiri harus berbuat demikian,\" katanya.\n\n'Pengistiharan harta selepas tawan Putrajaya'\n\nKemudian pada Mac 2018, ketika NGO Invoke mengundang para penggubal undang-undang HARAPAN mengisytiharkan aset mereka, Anggota Parlimen DAP, Tony Pua berkata wakil rakyat parti itu akan berbuat demikian sebaik merek amenjadi menteri atau exco kerajaan negeri.\n\n\"Itu pendirian DAP,\" kata Pua.\n\nPada 2004, pemimpin veteran DAP, Lim Kit Siang menyambut cabaran timbalan perdana menteri ketika itu, Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi terhadap DAP supaya pemimpin pembangkang mengisytiharkan aset mereka kepada orang ramai.\n\n\"Saya menerima cabaran Zahid supaya para pemimpin DAP secara terbuka mengisytiharkan aset kami - dengan syarat dalam tempoh dua minggu dari pengisytiharan aset awam, semua menteri kabinet, timbalan menteri, setiausaha parlimen, menteri besar, ketua menteri, ahli parlimen dan wakil rakyat menyatakan secara terbuka aset mereka serta keluarga terdekat mereka akan tertakluk kepada pengawasan dan akauntabiliti awam, \"katanya.\n\nSetahun sebelum itu, Lim menyarankan naib presiden Umno dan menteri dalam negeri semasa itu, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin untuk mengemukakan cadangan pindaan undang-undang pilihan raya agar menghendaki semua calon, sama ada daripada parti pemerintah atau parti pembangkang, mengisytiharkan aset mereka secara terbuka.\n\n\"Bukanlah dengan mencadangkan pengisytiharan aset oleh calon menjadi urusan dalaman Umno, beliau (Muhyiddin) sepatutnya mengetuai kempen untuk menukar undang-undang pilihan raya di parlimen pada September ini supaya semua calon dikehendaki mengisytiharkan secara terbuka aset mereka dalam era baru politik yang bersih, jujur dan tidak kotor,\" katanya.\n\nPada tahun 2013, Karpal Singh, ketika itu pengerusi DAP berkata semua wakil rakyat PKR dan PAS perlu mengisytiharkan aset mereka kepada orang ramai.\n\nKarpal berkata beliau akan menggesa Ketua Umum PKR Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim dan Presiden PAS Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang untuk mengarahkan wakil rakyat parti mereka agar mengisytiharkan asetnya.\n\nAnwar suarakan kembali tuntutan\n\nPAS pada waktu itu masih anggota Pakatan Rakyat, gabungan terdahulu sebelum Pakatan Harapan (HARAPAN).\n\nSelepas serbuan polis di kediaman yang dikaitkan dengan bekas perdana menteri Datuk Seri Najib Razak merampas sejumlah besar barangan kemas dan wang tunai pada bulan lalu, Anwar menggesa semua jemaah menteri HARAPAN mengisytiharkan harta mereka.\n\nJauh sebelum itu, pada 1999, ketika Anwar dan Mahathir baru 'bersengketa', perdana menteri ketika itu mendakwa beliau mempunyai bukti pembelian hartanah dan kontrak besar yang didapatkan kroni Anwar.\n\nHanya selepas kejatuhan awal mereka, kata Mahathir pada tahun 1999 bahawa beliau mempunyai bukti pengambilalihan hartanah dan kontrak besar yang dijamin oleh kroni Anwar.\n\nMahathir waktu itu berkata mendapat tahu mengenai perkara itu berdasarkan kepada borang perisytiharan aset dan senarai kontraktor yang diberikan projek besar.\n\nBeliau juga semasa itu mendakwa seorang kroni Anwar memiliki RM230 juta dalam bentuk wang tunai.\n\nSebaliknya pengkritik Anwar dan Mahathir sentiasa menuduh Perdana Menteri hari ini memperkayakan anak-anaknya menggunakan kedudukan dan kontrak kerajaannya.\n\nMalahan menjelang pilihan raya umum 9 Mei, terdapat desakan kepada SPRM untuk menyiasat Mahathir dan aset anak-anaknya.\n\n[Baca berita penuh]", "news": "Malaysiakini (caruman)",

ada sebahagiannya benar gusar, perihal ini semakin meruncing sedang sebilangan yang lain menjadikan ianya salah satu 'alat politik' menghangatkan rencam keterbukaan Malaysia baru.\n\nSetiap kelompok samada yang mempertahankan LGBT atau yang membantah ditambah lagi yang bermotifkan politik dengan sifat 'cuba, test, try' jelas terkelihatan pada hemat saya menduga antara satu sama lain tanpa memikirkan natijah tingkah mereka.\n\nApatah lagi pengakhiran yang akan diambil adalah meletakkan label di dahi seseorang itu dengan cop 'liberal, songsang, ekstrimis, rasis, homophobic' dan bermacam lagi gelaran, yang secara tak langsung bagi yang beragenda politik pula akan berterusan menduga tanpa sedar ianya mampu mencetuskan ketegangan.\n\nDalam isu (LGBT) ini, kita perlu memandang dua aspek tanpa prejudis, iaitu hak asasi manusia bagi penganut LGBT manakala yang kedua ialah teras umum terkait dengan Perlembagaan (juga perspektif Rukun Negara selaku tunjang dan asas).\n\nBersikap menghukum\n\nMalah selaku umat Islam, saya juga akan menyentuh pendangan agama (Islam) yang turut menjadi sendi negara pusaka ini.\n\nDari aspek kemanusiaan, apatah lagi di zaman 'canggih'-nya pemikiran manusia kini, sememangnya setiap dari kita punyai hak dari mengkritik atau mengecam sebegitu juga menyokong, dan seharusnya ini tidak menjadi pertikaian, kerana lumrah pemikiran 'canggih'. (Maka prejudis juga satu 'hak' bukan? Sebegitu juga untuk tidak prejudis)\n\nMaka benar apabila dikatakan bahawa terkait hak selaku individu, sang penganut LGBT punyai segenap hak untuk mempertahankan kecenderungan mereka, sebegitu juga ada kebenarannya apabila terdapat pihak yang mengatakan perihal ini (LGBT) adalah antara dia dengan Allah.\n\nDari segi kemanusiaan kita perlu memahami dan memberikan ruang atas kecenderungan kelompok ini tanpa bersikap menghukum.\n\nKenapa kita perlu menghukum? Dengan herdikan dan tohmahan yang sememangnya akan menjarakkan kelompok LGBT ini apatah lagi dari nilai keagamaan?\n\nKebanyakan mereka dari pengamatan dan penilaian saya adalah orang yang bijak pandai rata-ratanya namun mungkin sedikit terkeliru ataupun punyai gagasan pemikiran tersendiri yang jauh dari mana-mana pandangan agama khususnya Islam (dalam konteks Malaysia/ Muslim).\n\nNamun sikap masyarakat khususnya umat Islam itu sendiri, dengan caci-makinya adakah mampu menyelesaikan masalah ini? Malah mempersoalkan sebilangannya kenapa perlu berkawan dengan orang sebegini. Ini adalah kenyataan yang tidak memandang konteks yang lebih luas.\n\nMufti Wilayah Persekutuan, sahibus samahah Datuk Dr. Zulkifli Mohamad Al-Bakri, suatu ketika viral di media sosial menggunakan pendekatan mendekati kelompok transgender tanpa menghakimi mereka.\n\nApa mampu dicungkil dari tingkah ini adalah kerana pemikiran luas beliau dan hasrat 'dakwah' sebagai salah satu konteks yang ingin beliau terapkan kerana sekiranya kita bersikap keras pada kelompok ini, semestinya mereka akan menjauhi dan mampu menjadi fitnah kepada agama Islam atas kekeliruan mereka dari segi ilmu mahupun 'psikologi'.\n\nUsai bicara perihal hak individu, kita masuk dalam aspek kenegaraan. Ini perlu difahami oleh pendokong LGBT dan seluruh warga Malaysia tak kira kaum atau agama, yang sewajarnya mengambil langkah secara beserdehana dan dalam konteks Malaysia sepertimana penulisan saya yang seringkali saya tekankan adalah keperluan memeluk erat asas penubuhan Malaysia iaitu Rukun Negara yang berteraskan Perlembagaan Persekutuan.\n\nDalam aspek kenegaraan, sesungguhnya, tiada tempat untuk LGBT di negara Malaysia ini!\n\nIni kerana Malaysia dibangunkan atas asas yang kukuh yang memelihara kemurnian agama Islam khususnya selaku agama persekutuan. Kelestarian agama Islam ini turut disulam dengan asas pertama Rukun Negara yang membawa saling-paut dengan Perkara 3 dalam Perlembagaan Persekutuan.\n\nDijelaskan, asas pertama adalah 'kepercayaan kepada tuhan', yang berpaut dan meletakkan Islam sebagai ad-din yang mutlak tempatnya di Malaysia pada peruntukan 'Perkara 3(1); Agama Islam sebagai Agama Persekutuan' ini malah disulami pengukuhan pada asas ketiga iaitu keluhuran perlembagaan.\n\nDakwah agenda utama\n\nMaka jelas disini, tidak kira apa agama atau anutan, Islam adalah sendi negara dan segala yang bercanggah dengan norma kesyumulan Islam adalah ditegah dan tiada tempat dalam negara tercinta ini.\n\nNamun memahami ini, kita juga perlu menyelami nilai kemanusiaan dan menjadikan dakwah sebagai agenda utama. Maka tidak wajar untuk kita menghukum, mencaci sehingga mampu menjadi fitnah kembali ke atas agama Islam.\n\nDari perspektif Islam, Islam itu agama kemanusiaan, adalah agama yang sempurna. Ini jelas apatah lagi sebagai insan yang juga hamba dalam makna penyerahan, tunduk patuh kepada sang penciptanya serta yakin dengan keimanan mendakap erat Islam itu sebagai ad-Din.\n\nKesempurnaan Islam sehingga perkara yang telah disyariatkan tidak boleh ditambah dan dikurangi. Kewajiban umat Islam adalah ittiba\u2019 (menurut perintah).\n\nSelaras dengan firman Allah SWT:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0646\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0636\u0650\u064a\u062a\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e \u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064b\u0627\n\n\u201c\u2026 Pada hari ini telah Aku sempurnakan untukmu agamamu, dan telah Aku cukupkan kepadamu nikmat-Ku, dan telah Aku redhai Islam sebagai agama bagimu \u2026\u201d [Al-Maa-idah: 3]\n\n'Benar dan adil'\n\nAl-Hafizh Ibnu Katsir Rahimahullah (wafat th. 774 H) menjelaskan, \u201cIni merupakan nikmat Allah yang terbesar diberikan kepada umat ini, tatkala Allah menyempurnakan agama mereka. Sehingga, mereka tidak memerlukan agama lain dan tidak pula Nabi lain selain Nabi mereka, iaitu Muhammad SAW. Oleh itu, Allah SWT menjadikan baginda sebagai penutup para Nabi dan mengutusnya sebagai \"rahmatul lil a'lameen\".\n\nSehingga, tidak ada yang halal kecuali yang dihalalkan Allah, tidak ada yang haram kecuali yang diharamkanNya, dan tidak ada agama kecuali yang disyariatkanNya. Semua yang difirmankan adalah hak, benar, dan tidak ada pembohongan, serta tidak ada pertentangan sama sekali. Sebagaimana firman Allah :\n\n\u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e\u062a\u064f \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0651\u0643\u064e \u0635\u0650\u062f\u0652\u0642\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0639\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0644\u064b\u0627\n\n\u201cDan telah sempurna kalimat Rabb-mu (Al-Qur-an), (sebagai kalimat) yang benar dan adil \u2026\u201d [Al-An\u2019aam: 115]\n\nMaksudnya benar dalam khabar yang disampaikan, dan adil dalam seluruh perintah dan larangan. Setelah agama disempurnakan bagi mereka, maka sempurnalah nikmat yang diberikan kepada mereka\".\n\nBegitu jelas disini kesucian yang dipelihara agama. Sesungguhnya ciptaan Allah itu sempurna, namun lumrah kita sebagai hambanya lemah selaku insan.\n\nIktibar buat seluruh warga\n\nSekitar isu terkait LGBT, memetik firman Allah di dalam Surah As-Syu\u2019araa\u2019, ayat 165 dan 166 yang bermaksud:\n\n\u201cPatutkah kamu melakukan hubungan jenis dengan lelaki dari kalangan manusia,\n\n\u201cDan kamu tinggalkan apa yang diciptakan oleh Tuhan kamu untuk kamu (melakukan hubungan yang halal) dari badan isteri-isteri kamu? (kamu orang-orang yang bersalah) bahkan kamu adalah kaum yang melampaui batas (keinginan kebanyakan haiwan)!\u201d\n\nDemikian antara kalimah Allah yang menegah perbuatan seperti LGBT, selain kisah-kisah peringatan yang diceritakan dalam Al-Quran malah hadis-hadis yang tinggi sanadnya turut diriwayatkan sebagai pedoman.\n\nMoga penulisan ini sedikit sebanyak dapat dijadikan iktibar buat seluruh warga Malaysia. Kita saling memerlukan antara satu sama lain demi membina Malaysia ke arah yang lebih baik tanpa prejudis.\n\nBagi umat Islam, medan dakwah harus dijadikan landasan dalam tekad usaha serta doa moga Allah terus memelihara tanah tercinta ini dengan Islam tegak terpelihara sebagai contoh pedoman buat seluruh masyarakat mahupun umat.\n\nMOHD ASHRAF MUSTAQIM BIN BADRUL MUNIR ialah Exco ARMADA Malaysia (Pendidikan) Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU).\n\nTulisan ini pandangan penulis dan tidak semestinya mencerminkan pendirian rasmi Malaysiakini.\n\n.", "news": "Malaysiakini (caruman)", "url": "https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/433424", "language": "id", "summary": "Setiap kelompok samada yang mempertahankan LGBT atau yang membantah ditambah lagi yang bermotifkan politik dengan sifat 'cuba, test, try' jelas terkelihatan pada hemat saya menduga antara satu sama lain tanpa memikirkan natijah tingkah mereka.\nDalam isu (LGBT) ini, kita perlu memandang dua aspek tanpa prejudis, iaitu hak asasi manusia bagi penganut LGBT manakala yang kedua ialah teras umum terkait dengan Perlembagaan (juga perspektif Rukun Negara selaku tunjang dan asas).\nSebegitu juga untuk tidak prejudis)Maka benar apabila dikatakan bahawa terkait hak selaku individu, sang penganut LGBT punyai segenap hak untuk mempertahankan kecenderungan mereka, sebegitu juga ada kebenarannya apabila terdapat pihak yang mengatakan perihal ini (LGBT) adalah antara dia dengan Allah.\nDengan herdikan dan tohmahan yang sememangnya akan menjarakkan kelompok LGBT ini apatah lagi dari nilai keagamaan?\nDalam aspek kenegaraan, sesungguhnya, tiada tempat untuk LGBT di negara Malaysia ini!", "title": "'Tiada tempat untuk LGBT di Malaysia'", "date": "07-09-2018", "top-image": "https://i.malaysiakini.com/1140/804db3c59458b206cf54523a5d41427b.jpeg"}, {"keyword": ["bayi", "tahanan", "disambung", "tujuh", "seminggu", "pengasuhnya", "pengasuh", "bunuh", "berusia", "rayqal", "adam", "reman", "siasatan"], "authors": [], "text": "A+ A-\n\nMahkamah Majistret Selayang hari ini melanjutkan tempoh tahanan reman selama seminggu lagi ke atas seorang wanita berhubung kes bayi lelaki berusia lima bulan yang ditemukan mati di rumah pengasuh di Kampung Nakhoda, Batu Caves, di Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMajistret Nurul Izzah Hasan Basri mengeluarkan perintah reman itu bermula esok hingga 17 Julai selepas membenarkan permohonan polis untuk melanjutkan tempoh tahanan reman terhadap pengasuh wanita berusia 33 tahun itu.\n\nRabu lalu, pengasuh itu bersama-sama lagi seorang wanita berusia 36 tahun direman selama tujuh hari bagi membantu siasatan kes bunuh bayi Adam Rayqal Mohd Sufi.

A-\n\nCinta atau diperdaya? Inilah persoalan yang membelenggui isu perkahwinan yang melibatkan kanak-kanak perempuan di negara ini, lebih-lebih lagi sekiranya pasangan mereka adalah lelaki dewasa yang jauh lebih berusia.\n\nRamai yang berpendapat kanak-kanak perempuan tidak wajar dijadikan isteri pada usia terlalu muda, di mana mereka sepatutnya masih di bangku sekolah serta dalam jagaan dan bimbingan ibu bapa.\n\nMereka juga belum tahu banyak perkara terutamanya yang berkaitan dengan tanggungjawab sebagai isteri.\n\nAkta Kanak-Kanak 2001 memperuntukkan bahawa kanak-kanak di Malaysia adalah mereka yang berumur 18 tahun dan ke bawah.\n\nPakar Psikologi Klinikal di sebuah klinik swasta di Bangi Azlina @ Roszy Mohamad Ghaffar berkata kanak-kanak perempuan lazimnya tidak menyedari bahawa mereka menjadi mangsa dalam sesuatu \u2018hubungan terlarang\u2019.\n\nIni kerana, pasangannya \u2018mempersiapkan\u2019 kanak-kanak perempuan berkenaan dalam jangka masa tertentu sebelum membawa mereka ke tahap perhubungan seterusnya.\n\n\u201cAntara taktik berkenaan ialah dengan bersikap baik terhadap kanak-kanak, sering memujinya, memberi hadiah serta menyakinkan mereka bahawa perlakuan seksual adalah sesuatu yang biasa dalam sesuatu perhubungan,\u201d katanya.\n\nTahap intelek\n\nAzlina menjelaskan intelek kanak-kanak perempuan selalunya mula berkembang dari usia 13 tahun, dan ini menyebabkan pemikiran mereka lebih mudah \u2018menerima\u2019 kata-kata atau \u2018idea\u2019 yang diberi kepada mereka.\n\nPerkembangan intelek itu melibatkan tiga kemahiran iaitu berunding, menyelesaikan masalah dan membuat keputusan.\n\n\u201cKemahiran ini biasanya dibangunkan semasa berusia 13 hingga 18 tahun,\u201d kata Azlina, yang berpengalaman lebih 15 tahun dalam menangani kes sosial remaja seperti kehamilan luar nikah, lari dari rumah, penderaan seksual, murtad dan lain-lain.\n\nJusteru itu, beliau berpendapat kanak-kanak perempuan sama sekali belum bersedia dari segi psikologi untuk berkahwin.\n\n\u201cMungkin seseorang anak perempuan itu kita katakan matang sebab dia boleh membantu ibu bapanya, dia boleh buat kerja rumah, jaga adik dan sebagainya, tetapi sebenarnya dia tidak mampu untuk menghadapi dinamik hubungan suami isteri dan pengaruh keluarga.\n\n\u201cMereka akan terdedah pada penderaan mental tanpa mereka sedari dan akan menganggap diri mereka yang bersalah jika dimarahi atas sesuatu kesalahan,\u201d jelas beliau sambil menekankan bahawa peringkat umur itu belum benar-benar memahami realiti kehidupan serta tidak tahu tentang hak-hak mereka.\n\nMereka belum cukup matang untuk menghadapi situasi di mana mereka dibuli oleh individu yang berada dalam kedudukan membuli mereka, seperti suami yang tidak bertanggungjawab, madu, ibu mertua atau saudara ipar.\n\nPerkembangan biologi\n\nSelain itu, Azlina menekankan bahawa perkembangan psikologi kanak-kanak perempuan sangat dipengaruhi oleh perkembangan biologi mereka.\n\nKanak-kanak perempuan yang berumur antara 10 hingga 12 tahun akan mengalami haid di mana sistem reproduktif mereka baharu sahaja berfungsi mengeluarkan ovum.\n\n\u201cWalaupun dianggap baligh dan boleh mengandung jika melakukan hubungan seks, namun ovari mereka masih belum cukup kuat.\n\n\u201cRahim mereka cenderung mengalami kecederaan semasa hubungan seks serta risiko lain seperti kehamilan seperti keguguran. Hal ini bukan sahaja menjejaskan kesihatan fizikal malah boleh meninggalkan kesan psikologi.\n\n\u201cDan jika melahirkan anak, adakah mereka sudah bersedia untuk menanggung tanggungjawab sebagai seorang ibu?\u201d soal Azlina.\n\nBukan isu baru\n\nIsu perkahwinan bawah umur, khususnya yang melibatkan pasangan Islam, bukanlah perkara baharu dan sering menarik perhatian masyarakat.\n\nAntara kes yang pernah mendapat perhatian ramai dan menimbulkan kontroversi adalah perkahwinan antara Nor Fazira Saad, 12, dan Mohd Fahmi Mohamed Alias, 20, di Kedah pada 2014.\n\nTurut mendapat tumpuan ramai adalah perkahwinan pelajar tingkatan lima Nur Izzati Amiera Ishak, 17, dengan teman lelakinya Muhd. Muaz Mislan, 15, di Johor pada 2014.\n\nJika kebiasaannya perkahwinan bawah umur melibatkan pasangan remaja, kes yang berlaku di Gua Musang, Kelantan baru-baru ini mendapat pelbagai reaksi masyarakat kerana melibatkan seorang lelaki berusia 41 tahun dengan budak perempuan berumur 11 tahun itu.\n\nRata-rata tidak bersetuju dengan perkahwinan itu, yang didakwa dilangsungkan dengan kebenaran dan restu ibu bapa budak perempuan berkenaan di Kampung Padang Nyor berdekatan Sungai Golok, Thailand, pada pertengahan Jun lepas, sehingga ada yang mengaitkan perbuatan itu dengan fidofilia.\n\nNamun, ada juga yang menerimanya berdasarkan agama.\n\nRela atau mangsa?\n\nMufti Perlis Prof Madya Datuk Dr. Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, yang mengulas isu itu menerusi laman Facebook beliau, menjelaskannya berdasarkan pendapat Mazhab Al-Syafi\u2019i selain menghuraikan dalil-dalil dalam Islam yang mensyaratkan kerelaan wanita dalam sesuatu perkahwinan.\n\nNamun, katanya, kerelaan itu hendaklah dilihat dalam konteks yang sebenar pada tempat dan waktunya.\n\n\u201cAnak perempuan yang bawah umur, yang tidak memahami realiti apa yang dia persetujui, tidak boleh dianggap rela.\n\n\u201cRealiti dan cabaran kehidupan zaman ini dan dahulu juga tidak sama. Untuk hidup di zaman moden, di negara kita, anak perempuan perlukan pendidikan dan pelajaran yang secukupnya,\u201d jelasnya.\n\nMohd Asri berkata wali yang menikahkan anak kerana kemiskinan dan mahu memperoleh keuntungan tertentu daripada perkahwinan juga tidak layak menjadi wali.\n\n\u201cWali itu bermaksud pelindung. Dia sudah tidak menjadi pelindung. Bahkan dia sudah menjadi pemangsa,\u201d katanya.\n\nHukuman ringan\n\nPresiden Persatuan Peguam Syarie Malaysia (PGSM) Musa Awang pula berkata perkahwinan pasangan itu melanggar banyak peraturan dalam Enakmen Undang-Undang Keluarga Islam Kelantan 2002.\n\nAntara kesalahan yang dilakukan ialah menikahkan anak bawah umur iaitu di bawah umur 16 tahun tanpa kebenaran Mahkamah Syariah bagi bapa atau wali pengantin perempuan; kesalahan berpoligami tanpa kebenaran bagi pengantin lelaki; dan kesalahan bersubahat bagi semua yang hadir di majlis tersebut termasuk ibu, saksi dan ejen yang membawa mereka bernikah di selatan Thailand.\n\nSetiap kesalahan itu boleh dikenakan hukuman denda tidak melebihi RM1,000 atau penjara tidak lebih enam bulan atau kedua-duanya.\n\n\u201cBagaimanapun, hukuman yang dikenakan adalah terlalu ringan dan dilihat tidak berkesan untuk mencegah perbuatan seumpama itu daripada berulang,\u201d tegasnya.\n\nSehubungan itu, beliau menyarankan supaya kerajaan-kerajaan negeri mengkaji semula hukuman denda dan penjara bagi kesalahan menikahkan anak bawah umur dan kesalahan berpoligami tanpa kebenaran daripada denda maksimum RM1,000 kepada RM5,000 dan mengenakan hukuman penjara daripada enam bulan kepada tiga tahun.\n\n- Bernama", "news": "Malaysiakini (caruman)", "url": "https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/433425", "language": "id", "summary": "Ramai yang

tahun 1987.\n\nDi Parlimen Singapura pada Isnin, Menteri bagi Hal Ehwal Lua, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan berkata \u201cMalaysia sebelum ini mengakui bahawa mereka sendiri meminta untuk tidak meminta bagi semakan pada 1987 kerana mereka telah mendapat manfaat.\n\nDr Balakrishnan menyatakan bahawa 50 sen Malaysia bagi setiap 1,000 gelen yang dibayar oleh Johor adalah sebahagian kecil daripada kos sebenar merawat air.\u201d\n\nMalaysia, khususnya Johor mendapat manfaat daripada Perjanjian Air 1962 kerana Singapura dikatakan memberi subsidi harga selama ini.\u201d\n\nMedia tempatan melaporkan pada Isnin bahawa Singapura menanggung kos RM2.40 untuk merawat setiap 1,000 gelen air.\n\nJusteru, dengan menjualnya kepada Malaysia pada harga 50 sen, Singapura menyediakan subsidi sebanyak RM1.90 bagi setiap 1,000 gelen.\n\nSetelah membeli air yang telah dirawat, Johor kemudian menjual air kepada rakyatnya pada harga RM3.95 bagi setiap 1,000 gelen, memperoleh keuntungan sebanyak RM3.45 bagi setiap 1,000 gelen atau RM46 juta setahun, kata laporan itu.\n\nOleh kerana kita memilih untuk tidak menyemak semula harga air pada 1987, Singapura kemudian mengambil beberapa tindakan yang republik itu mendakwa juga memberi manfaat kepada kita termasuk pembinaan Empangan Linggiu berharga lebih S$300 juta (S$1=RM2.95).\n\nDr Balakrishnan berkata jika pada 1987, Malaysia telah melaksanakan hak untuk menyemak harga air, \u201cSingapura mungkin telah membuat keputusan pelaburan yang agak berbeza bagi pembangunan Sungai Johor dan kawasan-kawasan tadahan airnya.\u201d\n\n\u201cSatu contoh ialah Empangan Linggiu,\u201d kata menteri itu.\n\nBeliau berkata pada 1990, Public Utilities Board (PUB), agensi air kebangsaan Singapura dan Johor menandatangani perjanjian untuk membina Empangan Linggiu untuk meningkatkan kapasiti pengeluaran air di Sungai Johor bagi membolehkan pengeluaran air pada kadar 250 juta gelen sehari (mgd) oleh PUB.\n\n\u201cJohor memiliki Empangan Linggiu tetapi Singapura membayar bagi kos pembinaannya dan terus membayar bagi penyelenggaraannya.\n\n\u201cJumlah ini adalah melebihi RM320 jutan (S$208 juta pada kadar 1990) yang kita bayar kepada Johor pada 1990 sebagai pampasan bagi tanah yang digunakan bagi projek Empangan Linggiu dan bagi potensi kehilangan pendapatan akibat akitiviti pembalakan, dan sebagai bayaran satu kali bagi pajakan tanah bagi baki tempoh di bawah Perjanjian, kata Dr Balakrishnan.\n\nJohor dan Singapura menandatangani dua Perjanjian Air jangka panjang. Perjanjian yang pertama dimeterai pada 1961 dan tamat tempoh pada Ogos 2011.\n\nMenurut laman sesawang Kementerian Hal Ehwal Luar Singapura, di bawah Perjanjian pertama, republik itu berhak memperoleh \u201ckuantiti air mentah yang tidak terbatas dari Sungai Tebrau dan Sungai Skudai\u201d.\n\nSebagai balasan, perjanjian itu menyatakan bahawa Singapura akan membekalkan kepada Johor dengan air terawat yang berjumlah 12 peratus daripada air yang diimportnya.\n\nApabila Perjanjian Air 1961 tamat tempohnya pada 31 Ogos, 2011, Singapura menyerahkan kepada kerajaan negeri Johor loji rawatan Gunong Pulai dan Skudai serta rumah pam Pontian dan rumah pam Tebrau yang diselenggara dan diuruskannya dengan menanggung sendiri kosnya.\n\nKemudahan ini diserahkan kepada mereka secara percuma dan dalam keadaan baik, kata laporan itu.\n\nPerjanjian Air yang kedua dimeterai pada 1962 dan akan tamat tempoh pada 2061.\n\nDi bawah perjanjian tersebut, Singapura mempunyai hak untuk mendapatkan dan menggunakan air dari Sungai Johor sehingga maksimum 250 juta gelen air mentah sehari.\n\nSebagai balasan, Singapura membekalkan epada Johor dengan air terawat sehingga dua peratus daripada air yang diimportnya.\n\nPUB mendapatkan bekalan air dari Sungai Johor dan merawat air tersebut di Loji Air Johor yang terletak berhampiran Kota Tinggi di Johor.\n\nSelama bertahun-tahun, PUB atas permintaan Johor, membekalkan air tambahan boleh diminum kepada Johor termasuk semasa tempoh kemarau yang teruk dan berpanjangan di Johor.\n\nAir tambahan boleh diminum dibekalkan kepada Johor atas semangat muhibah dan tanpa menjejaskan hak-hak Singapura di bawah Perjanjian Air 1962, menurut laman sesawang itu.\n\n- Bernama", "news": "Malaysiakini (caruman)", "url": "https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/433630", "language": "id", "summary": "A+ A-Harga air di bawah Perjanjian Air 1962 boleh disemak semula tetapi kita mempunyai peluang untuk berbuat demikian secara bersama dengan Singapura pada 1987.\nJusteru, dengan menjualnya kepada Malaysia pada harga 50 sen, Singapura menyediakan subsidi sebanyak RM1.90 bagi setiap 1,000 gelen.\nSetelah membeli air yang telah dirawat, Johor kemudian menjual air kepada rakyatnya pada harga RM3.95 bagi setiap 1,000 gelen, memperoleh keuntungan sebanyak RM3.45 bagi setiap 1,000 gelen atau RM46 juta setahun, kata laporan itu.\n\u201cJohor memiliki Empangan Linggiu tetapi Singapura membayar bagi kos pembinaannya dan terus membayar bagi penyelenggaraannya.\nSelama bertahun-tahun, PUB atas permintaan Johor, membekalkan air tambahan boleh diminum kepada Johor termasuk semasa tempoh kemarau yang teruk dan berpanjangan di Johor.", "title": "Kita 'terlepas' peluang semak perjanjian air 1962 pada 1987", "date": "07/11/2018", "top-image": "https://i.malaysiakini.com/1280/086ede7c79dbab0c6633cff9f2522d8e.jpeg"}, {"keyword": ["account", "saudi", "funds", "king", "donation", "nation", "maintains", "najib", "rm26bil", "money", "donor", "returned"], "authors": [], "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak has reiterated that the US$681mil (RM2.6bil) found in his account prior to GE13, was a donation by the Saudi royal family.\n\nAccording to a report by news portal Malaysiakini, Najib stressed that RM2.5bil (US$620mil) of the total amount had been returned to the donor after GE13.\n\nNajib also noted that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had acknowledged the sum had been returned to the donor.\n\nNajib explained that the donation came following his meeting with the late Saudi ruler King Abdullah Abdulaziz Al Saud.\n\n\u201cThe genesis was when I met with King Abdullah. I asked him to support the (Malaysian) government because I thought their government has a record of supporting governments which are somewhat friendly with them.\n\n\u201cSo what I requested was nothing unusual and he agreed to support and subsequently we received letters and then money was credited at about the time they had promised the donation. I informed the relevant authorities. Bank Negara was informed of that fund that was coming in,\u201d he was quoted as saying on Monday (July 2).\n\nNajib subsequently launched a thinly-veiled attack against Pakatan Harapan for claiming that he pocketed the RM2.6bil donation.\n\n\"Pakatan Harapan tells the people that I took \u2018RM2.6bil\u2019 but they never said that the money was also returned by me to the same source. That is not fair.\n\n\u201cDoes it smack of somebody who was trying to cheat or steal? If the intention was to steal, why would I use a local bank account in my own name?\n\n\u201cI used the money for the election (GE13) and after the election, the (balance of the) money was returned.

On April Fool\u2019s, we published 2 contradicting articles which provided \u201cevidence\u201d in support of both the ruling government and the opposition, and from the general response, it really proved that people are really that people are really interested in trying to figure out who\u2019s going to WIN the election.\n\nSo you could only imagine our surprise (and excitement) when we stumbled upon this gorgeous program created by MalaysiaKini.\n\nThis GE14 simulator lets you experiment and test some of your wildest scenarios, using the results of GE13. Think the Malay tsunami\u2019s going to win PH the election? How is PAS going to lose all their seats? What happens if all of BN\u2019s Malay voters decide to vote for Pakatan instead?! This simulator can answer all those questions.\n\nBut before we begin, here\u2019s some of the limitations of the simulator\n\nThe prediction won\u2019t be completely accurate due to a few reasons:\n\nThe simulator only takes into account Malay and non-Malay voter swings . For example, what happens if all of PAS\u2019s non-Malay supporters supported Pakatan Harapan instead? This also means that Sabah and Sarawak will be excluded from the predictions, because of the many types of ethnic groups in East Malaysia. The simulator doesn\u2019t follow the newest electoral map , as GE14 will be the first election using the new boundaries. Voter composition, and number of voters would also still be based on GE13 statistics. Finally, PAS and Amanah are still one and the same , so we\u2019ll get very hypothetical when it comes to splitting the Malay votes for PAS.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the features that the simulator provides. It lists out the total amount of parliamentary seats after the swing of voters, along with the percentage of total votes held by each party. Beneath the main counter, it will also predict the change of state seats in each state, but we won\u2019t be focusing on this for the article.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ll need to remember that a party needs 112 parliament seats to form the federal government. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we fixed the number of seats in East Malaysia as per GE13 in all our of scenarios (BN 48 seats, PH has 9, PAS has none), and also assume there\u2019s no change in voter support in PH and PAS by default. Got all of that? Good. Now let\u2019s begin with our first scenario:\n\n1. The Malay Tsunami needed by PH to form the government\n\nAs you may have heard, there has been talk about a \u201cMalay tsunami\u201d from the rural areas in favor of PH, one of the reasons being Tun Mahathir siding with PH. Politicians from BN however, has brushed aside the idea, and said that support for BN will remain strong. But just for theory\u2019s sake, how tall must the Malay tsunami wave be for PH to win?\n\nAfter triple checking the value we changed, BN lost a staggering 25 seats with just 10% of Malay vote swing to PH. Meanwhile, PAS and PH gained 6 and 19 seats respectively. Adding the seats from East Malaysia, BN would have 108 seats, PAS 27 seats, while PH would have 87.\n\n10% of Malay BN voters rebel\n\nWith this 10% swing, PH could form the government only through a coalition with PAS, as they would together have 114 seats. Seeing how PAS once warned PH not to associate them with BN, maybe that\u2019s a possibility (??)? But PH was the one that broke up with PAS, so let\u2019s try to take away 10% of the Malay votes for PH, and 10% of non-Malay votes from PAS:\n\nWith our hypothetical disturbance for PAS and PH\u2019s voter base, BN actually lost less seats, but would still easily maintain a majority. So without a united PAS and PH, it would seem a Malay tsunami wouldn\u2019t do much for PH at all.\n\nBut purely in terms of BN Malay voter\u2019s swing, how much would PH require to win by themselves? The answer is 59%. Of course, if PH could win more seats in Sabah and Sarawak, the climb would be less steep, because at 50% of BN Malay voters swing, PH can already gain 100 seats in Peninsular alone.\n\nAlternatively, PH could count on PAS losing like 40% of Malay voters and 70% of non Maly voters, ON TOP of BN losing 30% of Malay voters. So for PH to win, a large portion of Malay BN voters would have to vote PH, regardless.\n\n2. The Chinese voter swing for BN to regain 2/3 majority in parliament\n\nA 2/3 majority is required in the parliament to pass certain laws, and also to make certain amendments to the constitution, and a party would have to win 148 seats for that. In GE13, BN won 133 seats, and needed 15 more for the 2/3 majority. Some analysts have suggested that a swing of 10 \u2013 15% of Chinese votes to BN would be suffice for a win with 2/3 majority, so let\u2019s test that:\n\n15% non-Malay PH voters switch to BN\n\nBN will still be short of 4 seats for the 2/3 majority. On top of that, the swing accounts for non-Malay voters, so it wasn\u2019t just the Chinese that changed the support. But what if we took into account the split of PH and PAS like before?\n\nSuddenly, BN has regained the 2/3 majority, and PAS and PH both suffered some losses.\n\n3. PAS losing all its seats in GE14\n\nAccording to a GE14 forecast by Rafizi Ramli\u2019s Invoke, PH is set to end up with 100 to 105 seats in the parliament, while BN would still retain control of the government with 117 to 122 seats. But most shockingly, Invoke predicts PAS to lose all its seats in the coming election! So we tried to make that happen, and it was much harder than we imagined:\n\n99% Malay voters switch to PH\n\nWe used 99% because the simulator annoyingly doesn\u2019t allow \u201c100%\u201d, but even after losing 99% of Malay voters, PAS would still be able retain 1 seat in Selangor. Perhaps more surprisingly, even when 99% of Malay voters from PAS goes to PH, BN still gained almost as much seats as PH. So what did it take to make PAS lose all their seats? We had to reduce their non-Malay support by 12% as well.\n\nSo PAS losing that much support just seems like a very extreme scenario, but while we\u2019re on extreme scenarios, we couldn\u2019t resist testing a couple more.\n\n4. BN loses all its non-Malay votes to PH!\n\nWith Malays being the majority supporters BN, have you ever wondered what would happen if BN lost all of their non-Malay voters? Would it be a devastating blow? Would it not matter to BN at all? Well, here\u2019s the result:\n\nBN actually lost 55 seats without the non Malay votes! And PAS managed to gain 19 seats in the process as well. State-wise, BN lost a total of 5 states to PH, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Malacca on top of Selangor and Penang. This outcome was similar to the Invoke\u2019s prediction, the only difference was that PH would capture Johor and Kedah instead of Perak and Negeri Sembilan.\n\n5. The Chinese and Malay tsunamis happens at the same time!!\n\nAssuming that both the scenarios mentioned above happened at the same time, where BN loses 50% of Malay voters, while PH loses an equal percentage of 50% of its non-Malay voters. How would that turn out for the election?\n\nHey, everyone will walk away pretty equal in this situation. BN wouldn\u2019t be able to form the government without a coalition with someone, and the same goes for PH. Perhaps this is the rumoured kingmaker position PAS is predicted to be in by some.\n\n6. PAS forms the government!!!(!)\n\nWe\u2019re deep in the rabbit hole now. Although not a scenario most people would consider, we just wanted to see what kind of change is needed for PAS to claim Putrajaya. First, we made a third of BN\u2019s Malay voters defect to PAS, and the results were stunning:\n\n33% of BN Malay voters switched to PAS\n\nNot only did PAS gained 39 seats, even PH gained 24 seats as a result. But 60 parliament seats is only about half of what\u2019s required to form the government, so we pushed the number further up. Surprisingly, even at 99% of BN Malay voters switch to PAS, they would still have less than 80 seats, so we tried to convert both PH and BN Malay voters at an equal percentage. At the end, we needed about 80% from both sides.\n\nWell close enough, but still short of one seat to form the government it seems. Might the non-Malay voters give PAS a better chance? Hardly, because PAS would need 95% of non Malay voters from both BN and PH to match this result. So whats the minimum swing of both Malay and non Malay voters that PAS need to win all by themselves?\n\n40% of Malay voters and 35% of non Malay voters from both BN and PH votes for PAS\n\nIn the last elections, BN got 85 seats with 45.7% of the total votes. But here, PAS will get 124 seats with 47.9% of total votes! It\u2019s actually kinda impressive because they can form a new government by themselves!\n\nOK, tired already. Why don\u2019t ugaiz try it out yourselves?\n\nThink we\u2019ve missed something? Think our scenarios are not accurate enough? Why don\u2019t you try it out yourselves here! And don\u2019t forget to let us know if you found something interesting in the comments. But there are 2 conclusions that we can confidently (quite) draw from this fooling around a) it\u2019ll be very hard for PH to win the election, b) BN will stand to gain in 3 corner fights.\n\nThere so many factors coming into play this election (an ex-PM leading the opposition for the first time against the ruling government, a movement advocating vote spoiling, 3 cornered fights in a large number of states, the recent redelineation, and a polling day right in the middle of the week), it\u2019ll be anyone\u2019s guess how it\u2019s going to turn out.\n\nBut what\u2019s for sure is, whoever you\u2019re supporting will definitely be needing your vote. The General Election is a once every half a decade thing, for people like you and us to decide where you want the country to go next. So in the end, our votes will be more predictive than any simulator.", "news": "CILISOS.MY", "url": "https://cilisos.my/how-many-malays-would-harapan-actually-need-to-win-we-tried-mkinis-ge14-simulator/", "language": "eng", "summary": "Finally, PAS and Amanah are still one and the same , so we\u2019ll get very hypothetical when it comes to splitting the Malay votes for PAS.\nAdding the seats from East Malaysia, BN would have 108 seats, PAS 27 seats, while PH would have 87.\nBut purely in terms of BN Malay voter\u2019s swing, how much would PH require to win by themselves?\nSo we tried to make that happen, and it was much harder than we imagined:99% Malay voters switch to PHWe used 99% because the simulator annoyingly doesn\u2019t allow \u201c100%\u201d, but even after losing 99% of Malay voters, PAS would still be able retain 1 seat in Selangor.\nSo whats the minimum swing of both Malay and non Malay voters that PAS need to win all by themselves?", "title": "We tried to make PAS win GE14 with this awesome simulator made by MalaysiaKini", "date": "04-13-2018", "top-image": "https://cilisos.my/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/30176593_10156170478629976_766530175_o-1024x534.jpg"}, {"keyword": ["avoided", "office", "answers", "tells", "tia", "balls", "low", "question", "arul", "kanda", "session", "journalist", "dont", "1mdb", "turn", "article"], "authors": [], "text": "The CEO of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) had a few choice words for a particular journalist from a news portal whom he branded a 'coward'.\n\nAn article that was just published in Malaysiakini which described Arul Kanda as at a loss for words during the interview at the news portal office had painted a picture of Arul as being cornered by the journalists and left \"rooted to the spot with little room to manoeuvre\".\n\nHowever, Arul Kanda revealed that the journalist who wrote the article that was openly critical of him recently was not even there.\n\n\"You don't have the balls to turn up and question me in your own office when I am there for three hours?\" Arul asked.\n\n\"I went to the office myself and four journalists interviewed me, asking questions about the 1MDB issue and I answered all of them based on facts.\n\n\"I was there for three hours but the author of the article was not even in the session.

"KUALA LUMPUR (May 25): In the first hours after the biggest political upset in Malaysia's history, the chief editor of news site Malaysiakini gathered his team in their cramped newsroom in a shabby industrial estate on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nSome journalists and volunteers brought in to cover this month's election that ousted the Barisan Nasional coalition from power after 61 years shed a few tears of joy, recounted Steven Gan, the editor.\n\nOthers fretted that a government that had relentlessly harassed them, even blocking their site during the vote count on election night, may still try to cling to power.\n\nWith widespread distrust in the largely party-owned or pro-Barisan press that skipped stories of corruption and gave little voice to opposition parties, reporting from alternative news sources like Malaysiakini played a major role in rousing an electorate angered by endemic graft and rising living costs.\n\nRemembering what he said to his staff that morning, Gan said it was no victory speech, but a simple message: \"It doesn't really matter who is in power, we as journalists will continue to do our job.\"\n\nWall-to-wall coverage of the fallout from the election since then has given a sense that Malaysia's media has been unshackled by the arrival of a new coalition that includes pro-democracy activists and has pledged to repeal anti-fake news legislation.\n\nHowever, uncertainty remains as to whether the mainstream media, conditioned to be cautious because of the diverse religious and ethnic mix in the country, will keep its focus on politics when the election fever dies down.\n\nOr whether the new administration led by 92-year-old Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad \u2014 who intimidated and muzzled the media when he was prime minister from 1981 to 2003 \u2014 is really prepared to cede more power to the fourth estate.\n\n\"Mahathir is not known to be a democrat, so there is some scepticism,\" said Gan. \"We are going through a period of euphoria and things are still in flux. It will take a few months before we know.\"\n\nSTRUCTURAL PROBLEMS\n\nAt the heart of the issue is that a number of Malaysia's mainstream news outlets are either owned by parties from the former coalition government or linked to state entities.\n\nThis allowed the political leadership to vet senior editorial appointments and influence coverage, stifling opposition voices during the campaign and sending readers elsewhere for the facts.\n\n\"In prison I had no access to newspapers, television, so in a way it was good. I kept my sanity by not reading local papers,\" reform leader Anwar Ibrahim joked as he addressed reporters last week after his release from prison, where he was jailed three years ago on charges of sodomy that he said were politically motivated.\n\nHe and Dr Mahathir came together in the alliance that won the May 9 election.\n\nIn the free-for-all that has followed, journalists at the likes of the Star, an English-language newspaper majority owned by one of the Barisan parties, have scrambled to catch up on big stories mostly ignored previously.\n\n\"Up until May 8, the mainstream media was used by the government to create an alternate reality which no thinking person could really have believed in,\" said Martin Vengadesan, news editor at the Star.\n\nThe paper this week published his interview with Clare Rewcastle-Brown, whose groundbreaking reporting on a financial scandal at state fund 1MDB was suppressed and led to her exile from Malaysia, on the front page.\n\n\"When I was interviewing (Rewcastle-Brown) and we were talking openly about ... corruption at the highest level, I had to keep checking myself because I was not used to this much openness,\" Vengadesan said in an e-mail.\n\nBut Vengadesan added that because of the Star's political ownership, it does face uncertainty.\n\n\"I don't have any answers as to what future direction we may take,\" he said. The Star's major shareholder, the Malaysian Chinese Association party, was in the former coalition government but lost all but one of its seats in the election.\n\nFor even the most intrepid reporters, years of persecution at the hands of the government have made them wary of promises of change.\n\nUnder the previous administration, financial newspaper the Edge and news site the Malaysian Insider were suspended, two cartoonists were charged for satirising Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, and charges were brought against Malaysiakini's co-founders, Gan and Premesh Chandran.\n\nLife was set to get even tougher under fake news laws brought in last month, under which misleading reports can lead to prison terms of up to six years.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Dr Mahathir's political alliance promised to repeal the fake news law but since the election the new premier has equivocated. \"Even though we support freedom of press and freedom of speech, there are limits,\" Dr Mahathir said.\n\nIn the early years of Dr Mahathir's first spell as prime minister, he suspended three newspapers \u2014 the Star, Sin Chew Daily and Watan \u2014 and used several laws to curb speech freedoms.\n\n\"After that, everybody did a lot of self-censorship and wanted to avoid problems,\" Chan Aun Kuang, editor-in-chief of Chinese-language newspaper Nanyang Siang Pau, told Reuters.\n\nHowever, this time, Dr Mahathir's party is a minority in the new ruling coalition, and if his authoritarianism resurfaced it is likely to be curbed by his partners. So far, he has shown a consultative approach in dealings with his new allies.\n\nAnwar, an enemy-turned-ally of Dr Mahathir who is expected to take over as prime minister at some point, has already sounded a different note.\n\n\"We are committed to the reform agenda, beginning with the judiciary, media and the entire apparatus,\" he said last week.\n\nTHE MALAYSIAN WAY\n\nEven if some of the publishing controls are dismantled, and government pressure subsides, some of the country's leading independent media outlets don't expect radical changes in a press corps conditioned for years to behave cautiously.\n\n\"We have our own way,\" said Kamarul Bahrain Haron, deputy editor-in-chief of Astro Awani, a round-the-clock news channel.\n\n\"We always love to say in editorial meetings an idiom or proverb in Malay: 'If there's a pound of flour, and just one strand of hair, you pull the hair without disturbing the flour,'\" he said, explaining that means being critical without creating a stir.\n\nAnother factor shaking up Malaysia's media landscape is familiar the world over: social media and the smartphone.\n\nFrom scurrilous gossip to footage of opposition rallies, many Malaysians turned to each other and to opposition leaders directly on Facebook, Whatsapp and Twitter in the run-up to the election, completely bypassing major media and the regulators.\n\n\"We're not following the government media stuff, they're a laughing stock,\" said Kuzi Romeo, who drives a taxi in Kuala Lumpur and prefers to get his news from Whatsapp groups instead.\n\nHe said he believed \"about 25%\" of what he reads in mainstream newspapers. \"Since the election, maybe 30%, they're still the same media,\" he said.", "news": "The Edge Markets MY", "url": "http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/telling-truth-power-still-no-easy-task-malaysias-revved-media", "language": "eng", "summary": "Or whether the new administration led by 92-year-old Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad \u2014 who intimidated and muzzled the media when he was prime minister from 1981 to 2003 \u2014 is really prepared to cede more power to the fourth estate.\nSTRUCTURAL PROBLEMSAt the heart of the issue is that a number of Malaysia's mainstream news outlets are either owned by parties from the former coalition government or linked to state entities.\nIn the early years of Dr Mahathir's first spell as prime minister, he suspended three newspapers \u2014 the Star, Sin Chew Daily and Watan \u2014 and used several laws to curb speech freedoms.\nAnwar, an enemy-turned-ally of Dr Mahathir who is expected to take over as prime minister at some point, has already sounded a different note.\nAnother factor shaking up Malaysia's media landscape is familiar the world over: social media and the smartphone.", "title": "Telling truth to power still no easy task for Malaysia's revved up media", "date": "05-25-2018", "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Malaysiakini_20180525183336_theedgemarkets.jpg?null"}, {"keyword": ["rafidah", "today", "statement", "rafidahs", "chairman", "confirms", "resignation", "resigned", "report", "malaysiakini", "pursuant", "thai", "regretted", "supermax"], "authors": [], "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (April 16): Supermax Corp Bhd confirmed today Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz had resigned as chairman of the rubber glove manufacturer.

According to a study by IPG Mediabrands\u2019 Initiative and Inventure, which surveyed 900 Malaysians nationwide to analyse the impact of media pre, during and post election, Malaysians consumed \u201ca lot more\u201d news than before, with notable increases in traditional platforms such as TV and newspapers. This could be attributed to the fact that mass mediums are seen as more credible, especially with the proliferation of fake news in circulation.\n\nClaimed circulation numbers by media owners stated that Sin Chew Daily had a circulation increase of 50,000 to 350,456, while China Press saw its circulation numbers increase by 24,549 to 270,039 during GE. Meanwhile, The Star witnessed a circulation increase of 20,194 to 222,137, while Berita Harian had a circulation increase of 70,000 to 139,985 during the GE.\n\nAccording to Initiative, this could be attributed to the fact that newspapers were seen to further capitalise on the rakyat\u2018s need to keep historical editions of the GE. Hence, many publications decided to increase circulation during that period.\n\nThe study also noted that 46% of Millennials and 48% of Gen X prefer their news in text article format, forming approximately one-third of the Malaysians surveyed. Both Millennials (32%) and Gen X (34%) listed live videos as their second preferred news format. On the other hand, live videos were the most preferred news format (36%) for Baby Boomers, followed by text articles (27%).\n\nFacebook and Malaysiakini among top 10 popular news sources\n\nFacebook came out on top as the most popular platform that Millennials and Gen X would turn to for news during GE. Astro Awani and Whatsapp were listed as the second most popular source of news for Millennials and Gen X respectively, while Malaysiakini was the third choice for both demographics. Meanwhile, Baby Boomers picked Malaysiakini as their top choice of news during GE, while TV3 and Facebook were their second and third choice.\n\nAccording to claimed traffic numbers by media owners, MyMetro had 2.5 million unique visitors pre-election from 30 April to 6 May. This was followed by Malaysiakini and The Star Online, which had 2.3 million unique visitors each. Sinar Harian, Sin Chew Daily and Berita Harian Online garnered 2.2 million, 2.1 million and 1.9 million unique visitors respectively.\n\nWhile all websites experienced an increase in traffic during the GE period from 7 to 13 May, Malaysiakini amassed the most unique visitors (7.5 million) followed by Astro Awani Online (7.0 million). Despite the slight decrease in website traffic post election, the numbers were still higher than the pre election period. This time, The Star Online had the most unique visitors (3.3 million), followed by MyMetro (3.0 million) and Sinar Harian (2.7 million).\n\nInitiative said that higher website traffic could be attributed to the change in behaviour as more Gen X and Baby Boomers consumed more online news post-election. It added that post-election, the most drastic change in media consumption came from the Baby Boomers. Online news overtook social sharing to become the top medium trusted. Also, while credibility and speed of news were important prior to and during the election, it was the talkability that was sought after post-election. Baby Boomers showed the highest change in percentage for talkability post election, from 18% to 28%. Millennials and Gen X, on the other hand, each only showed a 5% change.\n\nKey events that dominated digital narratives pre-election include \u201cUMNO Veterans\u201d, \u201cSupport of Mahathir\u201d and \u201cCeramah\u201d, while voting incidents at polling stations made headlines on the day of the election. Meanwhile, narratives surrounding the formation of the Malaysia government by the world\u2019s oldest premier, Anwar\u2019s pardon and release, as well as investigations on Najib and Rosmah dominated online conversations post-election.\n\nAccording to Kristine Ong, MD of Initiative, GE14 presents renewed hope for Malaysians in more ways than one. Credibility was the most important consideration among Millennials and Gen X when it comes to consuming news.\n\n\u201cAs news coverage becomes more balanced post-election, we are seeing early signs of a media revival.

Najib\u2019s ousting by the world\u2019s oldest elected leader cost his party rule for the first time since the country became independent in 1957.\n\nKhairil Yusof, a data transparency advocate who also trains and collaborates with newsrooms, said the transformation had been seismic: \u201cThe media changed the moment the results started coming in, after 11 pm.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not propaganda anymore, it\u2019s actually reporters providing hour by hour updates. Khairil Yusof\n\nYusof was monitoring the internet for censorship that night and noticed the Malaysiakini website had been temporarily blacked out. But other sites were live streaming the results, that surprised many.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing time in Malaysia,\u201d Yusof said. All of a sudden, he said, journalists could report \u201cfreely\u201d on what was actually going on.\n\n\u201cNow Malaysians can watch their TV again,\u201d said Yusof, speaking from Kuala Lumpur as TV was broadcasting images of police raiding Najib\u2019s home. \u201cIt\u2019s not propaganda anymore, it\u2019s actually reporters providing hour by hour updates.\u201d\n\nIn the last few years of his almost decade-long tenure, Najib\u2019s government was hit by a complex corruption scandal that triggered asset seizures and investigations in at least eight countries. According to the U.S. Justice Department, about $4.5 billion was stolen from the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), by high-level officials.\n\nNajib, who set up the fund in 2009, has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. But, since the scandal broke in 2015, the few journalists who kept investigating the scandal suffered the consequences of his repressive government.\n\n\u201cTill then the online media had been relatively free by comparison [with newspapers and broadcasters],\u201d said Clare Rewcastle-Brown, a Malaysia-born investigative journalist who runs The Sarawak Report news site. \u201cAs a result, most of the country had switched to that medium to get reliable information and Najib \u2018realized\u2019 he needed to take measures to bring it under control.\u201d\n\nOn April 30, 2015, the Malaysian police arrested the top executives of two local media outlets, The Edge Media Group and The Malaysian Insider, on charges of sedition, after they revealed links between Najib\u2019s allies and 1MDB. They were later released, but the Edge\u2019s publication license was suspended for three months.\n\nIn July that year, the Sarawak Report was blocked after exposing a multimillion dollar deposit to Najib\u2019s personal account. The police issued an arrest warrant against Rewcastle-Brown and applied to Interpol to have her extradited from the United Kingdom, where she was living.\n\nRewcastle-Brown said she\u2019d been treated as \u201can enemy of the state\u201d and had suffered cyber attacks, false news accusations and surveillance.\n\nClare Rewcastle-Brown, a Malaysia-born investigative journalist, was celebrated after the leadership change earlier this year.\n\nBut after the new prime minister was sworn in last month, she finally felt vindicated, she said. The warrant was lifted and her website was unblocked. On her return to Kuala Lumpur, strangers took selfies with her. One of the largest newspapers in the country ran a long article with a picture of her on the front page, and an online piece titled \u201cNo Changes Without Brave Individuals.\u201d\n\nFor others, too, that front page was a symbol of change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stunning,\u201d said May Yee Chen, a Malaysian freelance journalist who has seen the media landscape change radically in the past two decades. \u201cSince the election, it\u2019s been night and day.\u201d\n\nReporters in Malaysia can now cover issues that were considered taboo, from corruption to religion to the many business interests that influence politics.\n\nBut they are calling on the new government to repeal the many draconian laws that could still be used to punish the free press.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest opportunity to wipe the slate clean and fix all the wrongs,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very heady time for Malaysian journalism.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of years Najib spent as prime minister.

So, let us not get too excited about it. Let us look at the items, every single item, and we hope to have a chance to examine these items,\u201d Najib was reported as saying in a Malaysiakini interview yesterday.\n\nHe added that he was not provided with the full and detailed list of the items seized during the raids last month.\n\n\u201cBut what I do know is over the years as head of the government, we have been gifted with a lot of items by foreign leaders as well as personal friends, and I do know under the law, it is not illegal to receive gifts. These gifts were accumulated over decades,\u201d he said in the report.\n\nNajib also said like any husband, he was unaware of the extent of his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor\u2019s collection of jewellery and other items.\n\nHe noted that Rosmah herself was surprised about the police\u2019s latest disclosure yesterday. \u201cI think the valuation ... she doesn\u2019t believe it will come up to that amount. And also some items, the jewellers have got records that they were sent for viewing and to be returned. So we need to identify these items and return them,\u201d he added.\n\nNajib said a sizeable amount of the jewellery seized does not legally belong to Rosmah. Some belonged to their daughter Nooryana Najwa, her husband and mother-in-law.\n\nAsked by Malaysiakini if it was ethical for someone in his position to accept valuable gifts, Najib cited former US president Barack Obama\u2019s wife Michelle who had received millions from the late Saudi ruler King Abdullah Abdulaziz Al Saud.\n\nNajib also said if the gifts are given by other heads of state during occasions such as one\u2019s birthday and they are not expecting anything in return, it is not illegal.\n\n\u201c[Prime Minister Tun Dr] Mahathir [Mohamad] said on record he received 40 horses from his friends. I am sure there are other gifts [that] he [had] received as well throughout his career,\u201d said Najib.\n\nOn the RM116 million cash in 26 different currencies seized by the police during the recent raids, which the former premier had claimed earlier to be for expenses for the 14th general election (GE14), Najib said: \u201cYou will not know how much it (an election campaign) costs exactly. You will not know as well how much people will contribute to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to have a clean zero balance so to speak. In any case, when you fight an election, you have to spend pre-election, during election and post-election. Don\u2019t forget I was president of Umno, and BN (Barisan Nasional) with 13 component parties,\u201d he told Malaysiakini, noting some of the cash belonged to him.\n\n\u201cThere were some of my own because I have been travelling for over 30 years, but there were also contributions in foreign currencies. Some people rather contribute in foreign currencies.\u201d\n\nOn why the cash was kept at the Pavilion Residences, Najib explained that things were done in a haste following GE14 results. \u201cBecause it all happened in a hurry, you see. We had to vacate within two hours \u2014 the PMO (Prime Minister\u2019s Office) and Sri Perdana.\n\n\u201cThe intention is quite clear. They know when you fight an election, you also have to maintain cash. The opposition knows it as well. They also maintain cash.\u201d\n\nThe former premier also alleged that \u201cone of Dr Mahathir\u2019s people\u201d had collected RM10 million in cash from him for GE13. Describing him as one of Dr Mahathir\u2019s \u201ctrusted aides\u201d, he said the money was collected from his residence in Jalan Duta.\n\nMalaysiakini reported that although Najib revealed the person\u2019s name, it is withholding his identity pending his response.\n\n\u201cWe have no system in this country for that (declaring gifts). I actually suggested in 2010 that there should be, when it came to donations, that we should have a system of transparency and we should record the donations with some independent body. I had that specific proposal, but at that time, it was rejected by the opposition, who are now part of the government.\u201d\n\nThis article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on June 28, 2018.\n\nFor more stories, download EdgeProp.my pullout here for free.", "news": "EdgeProp.my", "url": "https://www.edgeprop.my/content/1398773/najib-deems-rm11b-valuation-%E2%80%98subjective-and-unrealistic%E2%80%99", "language": "eng", "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR (June 28): The RM1.1 billion valuation of the luxury items seized by the police from properties linked to Datuk Seri Najib Razak has been deemed \u201csubjective and unrealistic\u201d by the former prime minister.\nLet us look at the items, every single item, and we hope to have a chance to examine these items,\u201d Najib was reported as saying in a Malaysiakini interview yesterday.\nHe added that he was not provided with the full and detailed list of the items seized during the raids last month.\nI am sure there are other gifts [that] he [had] received as well throughout his career,\u201d said Najib.\nMalaysiakini reported that although Najib revealed the person\u2019s name, it is withholding his identity pending his response.", "title": "Najib deems RM1.1b valuation \u2018subjective and unrealistic\u2019", "date": "06-27-2018", "top-image": "http://dbv47yu57n5vf.cloudfront.net/s3fs-public/editorial/my/2018/June/28/Najib_4_KY.jpg"}, {"keyword": ["angkuh", "rafidah", "undangundangmentadbir", "harapan", "fikir", "undangundang", "sombong", "lari", "tuhan", "aziz", "wawancaranya"], "authors": [], "text": ": Kepimpinan kerajaan Pakatan Harapan (Harapan) diingatkan agar tidak angkuh dalam mentadbir negara.Bekas Menteri Kabinet, Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz berkata, sikap sombong akan membuatkan seseorang itu berfikir boleh lari daripada undang-undang.\u201cMentadbir urus (negara) tak boleh angkuh.

urges new communications minister Gobind Singh to investigate MCMC's past misdeeds under the BN government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) today called on new Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo to probe the past misdeeds of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and restrict its powers so that no abuse happens again.\n\nIts executive director Eric Paulsen praised Gobind for getting MCMC to improve and regulate the communications and multimedia industry instead of allowing it to be used as a political tool, as he said was done under the previous administration.\n\nHe also hailed Gobind\u2019s plans to repeal the Anti-Fake News Act 2018 and investigate the block on Malaysiakini\u2019s live election results site, as well as the mysterious bot attacks against politicians on election day.\n\nIn a statement, he said Gobind should also uncover \u201cfurther wrongdoings\u201d by the MCMC and ensure it becomes accountable to the public.\n\nHe also urged the minister to investigate the October 2017 personal data breach expose of over 46 million mobile phone subscribers, in addition to other personal medical and employment records from Jobstreet.com and various medical associations, that were compromised and sold.\n\n\u201cThe now-infamous largest data breach in Malaysian history has been traced back to MCMC\u2019s outsourcing of a phone-blocking system to the little-known company Neumera Sdn Bhd, and until today MCMC has not come clean on the scandal.\n\n\u201cFurther, we fully expect MCMC\u2019s investigation and prosecution policies to be updated and revamped to prevent the widespread abuse of power that we saw under the previous BN administration, when these powers were misused to clamp down on political opponents and dissidents online.\u201d\n\nPaulsen said Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 (CMA), which had been the basis for \u201cmany frivolous arrests and prosecutions\u201d relating to social media comments, must be amended as soon as possible to specify the scope of the offence.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the offence should only be limited to serious and well-defined online threats, harassment or bullying against a weaker party, an ordinary individual, and cannot be used by government leaders or officials against dissidents or political opponents as was the practice under the previous BN administration.\u201d\n\nHe welcomed the move to unblock Sarawak Report, Asia Sentinel, Medium and other websites and blogs that were blocked due to their critical content against the BN administration.\n\nHowever, he said, LFL was concerned that this power to block had been too easily abused and might be illegal as there was no legislative provision in the CMA empowering MCMC to do so.\n\n\u201cWe would therefore strongly urge the minister to instruct MCMC not to block anymore websites until legislative amendments can be done, and clear guidelines put in place in order to better define the scope and powers of the MCMC when dealing with websites or contents that they view as illegal or prejudicial to public order or security.\u201d", "news": "Free

We have never had to deal with this before. Before we never faced debts higher than RM300 billion, but now it has climbed to RM1 trillion.\"\n\nDr Mahathir, 92, was Malaysia's prime minister from 1981 and 2003.\n\nThe Prime Minister came out of retirement and joined hands with the then Pakatan Harapan (PH) opposition pact to oust Mr Najib, whom he accused of corruption.\n\nPH exceeded the expectation of many political observers and defeated the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition that has ruled the nation for six decades at the 9 May general election.\n\nThe next day, Dr Mahathir was sworn in as the country's seventh prime minister.\n\nIn his address, Dr Mahathir also lamented the decline in respect for the country, which was \"once looked up upon as among the best in Commonwealth countries,\" saying, \"Our country was well-respected previously, but now it is not the same as in the past. We must restore the country to ensure that it will be looked highly upon and respected once again.\"\n\nHe said that it was imperative to keep the country\u2019s institutions independent and separate, saying, \"The separation of powers among us must be maintained, as only through this way we can make sure there is not embezzlement in the country\u2019s administration. We have to separate the lawmakers, the enforcers of the law, and the judiciary.\"'\n\nHe then noted that allowing the three pillars of government to intermingle would erode their accountability and allow one to dominate the others to the point that they could no longer check each other, adding that co-mingling of powers could even facilitate actions that were against the laws, as those entrusted to enforce these would be complicit with those breaking them.\n\nMr Najib was previously accused by critics of concentrating power in the hands of the executive that he controlled, neutering the powers of the legislature and judiciary to act as watchdogs to his administration.\n\nDr Mahathir said many changes needed to be made, however, he was heartened that it could be done with the help of civil servants.\n\n\"We are confident that we can overcome the challenges but we need civil servants who are efficient and trustworthy to achieve this changes. As administrators, one must put the rule of law above all else and those tasked to carry out their duties must help to clean things up so that Malaysia can be on the road of recovery.

He needs this to put fear in people, that they can go to jail if they criticize him,\" he told CNN.\n\nCalling it \"useful for the elections,\" Zaid said political campaigners are already becoming wary of what they say, even though the bill hasn't even been passed yet.\n\nHe added that the 1MDB scandal -- which has seen Najib accused of misappropriating massive amounts of money -- has \"everything to do\" with the anti-fake news bill.\n\nThe scandal has made numerous headlines in the international media, and Zaid said Najib will apply the new law to protect himself and try \"everything possible to put a stop to the 1MDB investigation.\"\n\n\"We are the most oppressive country in the world,\" he said.\n\nThe former minister is not the only person who has come out against the bill. Najib's own brother, Nazir Razak, chairman of the CIMB banking group, has taken to social media to call for it be deferred.\n\nThe Malaysian Bar Council has also urged that the bill be withdrawn, with its president George Varughese saying the organization is \"deeply troubled\" by the proposed legislation, and calling it \"legislative overkill.\"\n\nCrackdown on satire\n\nVarughese said since the proposed law criminalizes fake news but does not clearly define it, it could be used to suppress freedom of expression.\n\n\"The wording of the provisions is sufficiently wide for an action to be brought challenging 'correct' or 'incorrect' views on, for example, economy, history, politics, science and religion,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHe added the proposed legislation does not deal with a situation if the government publishes \"fake news.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Varughese highlighted the international ramifications of the law, saying if an alleged offender is in a country with whom Malaysia has an extradition treaty, it's possible for that person to be sent there for punishment.\n\n\"Also they run the risk of being arrested and charged the moment they set foot in Malaysia,\" he added.\n\nThe lawyer also expressed \"serious concern\" caricature, parody and satire \"which by their very nature may involve some embellishment\" would now be criminalized.\n\nA student activist holds up a clown-faced caricature of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak (Mohd Rasfan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNajib and his government have been the butt of a great many jokes and have often responded with criminal and civil suits\n\nArtist Fahmi Reza was jailed and fined earlier this year for portraying Najib as an evil clown, while political cartoonist Zulkiflee SM Anwarul Haque, known popularly as Zunar, has been slapped with sedition charges, travel restrictions and a ban on nine of his comic books.\n\nMalaysia already has a plethora of laws that can been used to control media and individual freedoms, Varughese said.\n\n\"There is no need for this law. All that this act is intended to cover is already in other legislation,\" he said.\n\nThese include the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984, the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, the Sedition Act 1948 and the Official Secrets Act 1972.\n\nThese laws grant the government broad powers to, among other things, arrest and detain individuals without trial, classify government documents, shut down publishers -- and punish false news with criminal charges.\n\nEchoes of Donald Trump\n\nThe phrase \"fake news\" has gained traction in Southeast Asia since it was popularized by US President Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nOfficials in Myanmar have used it to disparage international coverage of the Rohingya crisis. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has hurled the term at Rappler, an online news publisher and one of his staunchest critics.

The site has been taken to court, threatened with closure and raided by police several times in its 18-year history.\n\nGan says he's \"pretty sure\" the law is for the government to defend itself in the elections.\n\n\"It cannot argue to defend its record, so this will stop the opposition from attacking them,\" he said.\n\nOf particular concern to Gan is that the government could make an ex-parte application to the courts over alleged offenses -- which means offenders would not be present or able to defend themselves.\n\n\"The court will only hear one side -- the government's side. A court order will be issued and if you don't take it down, it's an additional offense,\" he said. \"You can challenge it, but if the government uses public order or national security as a reason, then you have no chance.\"\n\nGan added the jail term and huge fines could deter whistle blowers and journalists from coming forward: \"If there was a similar law in the US in the 70s, there would probably have been no Watergate.\"", "news": "CNN", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/30/asia/malaysia-anti-fake-news-bill-intl/index.html", "language": "eng", "summary": "(CNN) Is an anti-fake news law proposed in Malaysia really designed to protect the country's citizens, or is it just a way for the government to clamp down on the media and stifle free speech?\nIn February, de facto law minister Azalina Othman Said said the government is prioritizing the bill because fake news threatens national security.\n'Legislative overkill'However, Zaid Ibrahim, a former minister in charge of legal affairs, was blunt in his assessment of the bill.\nCrackdown on satireVarughese said since the proposed law criminalizes fake news but does not clearly define it, it could be used to suppress freedom of expression.\nMalaysia's bill has been labeled especially draconian by Steven Gan, the editor-in-chief of prominent online news site, Malaysiakini.", "title": "Malaysia's anti-fake news law raises media censorship fears", "date": "03-30-2018", "top-image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161013122502-najib-razak-super-tease.jpg"}, {"keyword": ["unlikely", "project", "state", "interfere", "million", "company", "chief", "individuals", "penang", "cm", "zarul", "boss", "tunnel", "zenith", "minister"], "authors": [], "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (July 3): Former Penang chief minister and current finance minister \"has bigger issues to settle\" in Putrajaya and most probably not \"interfere\" in the state\u2019s tunnel project, Consortium Zenith Construction Sdn Bhd (CZC) senior executive director Zarul Ahmad Mohd Zulkifli.\n\nSpeaking to the news portal Malaysiakini, Zarul said the fate of the RM6.3 million tunnel project lies \u201cvery much on the current Penang leadership\u201d, led by Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow.\n\n\"It all depends on the stewardship of our current chief minister.\n\n\"We will provide him with all the feasibility reports.

The news came just one day after Nazifuddin was seen supporting his embattled father in court.\n\nWhile many netizens were debating various aspects of this outing, especially on the fact he was spotted drinking wine, Pemantau Malaysia Baru president Lokman Noor Adam has come out in defense of Nazifuddin\u2019s actions, saying that it was fine for Nazifuddin to enjoy his life. He also said that those photos were \u201cnothing unusual.\u201d Of course, Nazifuddin looked like he had a very relaxing trip wining and dining with his friend!\n\n\u201cWho is the politician, me or him? It is me, so it is my job to take care of the people; he is a businessman, so his job is to enjoy his life. We ensure that justice is upheld, that our system (and leaders) truly practise what they preach \u2013 that \u2018Malaysia Baru\u2019 will implement the rule of law. At the moment, they are showing us the law of the jungle; there is no rule of law at all,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Malaysiakini, the couple are actually old friends that had known each other for years. Coincidentally, he had a meeting in Taiwan and arranged to meet up with her to catch up while he was there.\n\nZhang said, \u201cWe never discuss politics especially when this is so sensitive. Besides, he has been in business for a long time and is no longer involved in politics,\u201d when asked about the reunion. Nazifuddin had reportedly flown back to Malaysia on July 6.\n\nSome of the photos captured by Taiwanese newspaper showed the couple being rather intimate but her agent, Sam has refuted claims that both of them were in a relationship. China Press reported that Sam also said the photos did not tell the whole story and media had \u201cgreatly distorted their friendship.\u201d\n\nSam explained, \u201cIt was a meeting between two old friends so of course there would be some physical contact. It is totally normal for them to hold hands and touch each other as they have a very good friendship.\u201d Sam didn\u2019t mention about the kiss though.

Apparently, Umno knows more than DAP about Kuok\u2019s alleged donation to our party.\n\n\u201cUp to now, no proof has been shown by Umno except to challenge DAP to prove otherwise. This is absolutely ridiculous,\u201d he said.\n\nYesterday, Nazri was reported to have said that he will not apologise to Kuok, although the tycoon\u2019s office has denied an allegation that he funded DAP to topple the BN government.\n\nThe Umno supreme council member had said his earlier statement criticising Kuok over the allegation was based on what Raja Petra Kamarudin wrote in his blog and which had not been denied by Kuok then.\n\nNews portal Malaysiakini had reported that Nazri had challenged Kuok to return to Malaysia and contest in the next general election.\n\nKuok, however, has denied funding DAP to oust the government, as alleged by Raja Petra.\n\nThe tycoon\u2019s office said Kuok reserved the right to sue Raja Petra over the allegation.\n\nNazri said it was good that Kuok had denied the allegation but he should have done it much earlier.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "url": "http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/02/28/personal-attacks-against-kuok-uncalled-for-says-guan-eng/", "language": "eng", "summary": "Penang CM says Tourism and Culture Minister Nazri Aziz's comments in attacking Malaysian tycoon show how extremist Umno is.\nGEORGE TOWN: The personal attacks carried out against tycoon Robert Kuok by the likes of federal ministers such as Nazri Aziz and Tajuddin Abdul Rahman are uncalled for, Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng said today.\nThese are personal attacks.\n\u201cThese attacks against Kuok show how extremist and racist Umno is,\u201d he said at a press conference here today.\nHe said such fake news and ferocious personal attacks, with calls for removal of citizenship or challenges to contest in the 14th general election, have angered not only the Chinese community, but also Malaysians generally.", "title": "Personal attacks against Kuok uncalled for, says Guan Eng", "date": "02-28-2018", "top-image": "http://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lim-guan-eng-nazri.jpg"}]
